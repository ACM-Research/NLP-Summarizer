{"original_text": "This actually happened a couple of years ago. I grew up in Germany where I went to a German secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). My school was named after Anne Frank and we had a club that I was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about Anne Franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, Hitler, the Third Reich and that whole Spiel. Basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. \n\nThis was my last year at school and I already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. I was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. We start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about Anne Frank and the Third Reich? You'd be surprised how much they know. Anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. After the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. One group watches a short movie about Anne Frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. Then the groups switch. \n\nI'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and I take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. I'm going down the list when I come to the name Sandra (name changed). A kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in Germany, pipes up. \n\nNow keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). This being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for German standards) Bavaria, I was confused. I looked down at the list again making sure I had read the name right. Look back up at the kid. \n\nMe: \"You're Sandra?\"\n\nKid: \"Yep.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, sorry. *Thinking the kid must be from somewhere where Sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* Where are you from? I've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.\"\n\nThe class starts laughing. Sandra gets really quiet. \"I am a girl...\" she says. Some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met Sandra. I feel so sorry and stupid. I get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. We watch the movie in silence. After the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place I apologised to Sandra. I felt so incredibly terrible, I still do to this day. Throughout the rest of the day I heard lots of whispers about Sandra. I tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip I had set in motion.\n\nSandra, if you're out there, I am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. I hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. Don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. I'm sorry I probably made that day hell for you. I'm sorry for my ignorance.\n\n**TL;DR: Confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. Kids are mean.

{"original_text": "It was last October, but I'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  \n\nAfter my mom died from cancer last year, I started looking for my estranged father.  I had only known him for a short time when I was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  I never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so I didn't push her for information about him.  I figured he didn't care about us.\n\nI had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and I didn't have an address with which to search.  After her death, I felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that I have a beautiful little girl.  It felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.\nI googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  I called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since I'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  It wasn't.\n\nI had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  He told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  He said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  My mom was the best woman I've ever known).\n\nSo, we started talking and skyping.  We spent a lot of time learning about each other. Knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but I tried to believe that people can change for the better.  \n\nHe was exactly everything I needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  Eventually, I told him that I loved him after months of talking with him.  He was over-the-moon.\n\nFast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  This is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that I sound like an ass.  I say this because I don't have a precise reason or event that I can point to as to why I don't trust him.  Why he actually makes me really nervous.\n\nMy dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  He doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  He doesn't give personal space and, when I spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while I was sleeping.  He said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but I really felt uncomfortable with it.  I couldn't sleep and was so glad that I didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.\n\nHe also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  I said \"no\" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  It wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  \nI've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  I have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  \n\nDuring the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  I was so grateful for it that I kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  He actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if I cited my daughter and husband as reasons that I needed to chill with the phone.  He never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  He also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  \n\nAgain, I know people can change, but at this point, I find myself wanting less contact with him.  The idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  I don't want to hurt him, but I just can't trust him.  I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.\n\nThank you for reading and I sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very Happy Father's Day!\n\nETA:  TL;DR  I found my estranged Dad, thought I loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind.\n\n", "tldr": "  i found my estranged dad, thought i loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind.", "summary_text": "i met my dad for the first time in my entire life and i feel like an ass because i don't know why i don't trust him.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.27999999503200007, "p": 0.25925925925925924, "r": 0.30434782608695654}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.1999999950500001, "p": 0.18181818181818182, "r": 0.2222222222222222}}], "compression_ratio": 0.027300541303836197, "original_pos_tags": {"PRP": 139, "VBD": 75, "JJ": 51, "NNP": 8, ",": 32, "CC": 41, "VBP": 17, "VBG": 30, "DT": 41, "NN": 89, "IN": 101, "RBS": 2, ".": 46, "PRP$": 29, "RB": 63, "VBN": 11, "WRB": 8, "CD": 3, "JJR": 3, "MD": 17, "VB": 40, "NNS": 20, "WDT": 4, "TO": 22, "JJS": 2, "RP": 1, "(": 1, ")": 1, "VBZ": 9, ":": 3, "``": 1, "''": 1, "RBR": 1, "PDT": 1, "POS": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"NN": 6, "VBD": 1, "PRP$": 2, "IN": 4, "DT": 2, "JJ": 3, "CC": 1, "VBP": 3, "RB": 2, "VB": 2, "WRB": 1, "NNS": 1, "PRP": 1, ".": 1}}
{"original_text": "Flashback to the past, almost exactly one year ago. You\u2019re 25 and currently at your peak on many levels. Your physique is at its best it\u2019s ever been and you\u2019re excelling in your professional life. You just completed a big project, you\u2019re driving home with a big smile on your face and amazing prospects are waiting. Your confidence is at its highest. You think making mistakes is not a problem, there\u2019s all the time in the world to make apologies, fix what you\u2019ve done wrong and make amends. Your social life is busy and just the way you want it. You\u2019ve surrounded yourself with successful friends, hoping they would push and propel you in the right direction. A feel-good rush that seems to last forever. You still live at home though, saving all your money and have been doing that for years. There\u2019s a good reason to do so: you don\u2019t want to lock yourself into a position where you\u2019d really wanted to do something but couldn\u2019t because of financial or other reasons. You are convinced that at some time, some big change will come, something you really want to do, and you\u2019ll be able to, by then relying on the resources you\u2019ve been stashing for years. You find this very important.\n\nDuring your most successful, eventful and fulfilling month, right smack bang in the beginning of summer, when free time is abundant, an opportunity presents itself. And not just any opportunity. A once in a life-time thing and it\u2019s huge. You know it. A sudden realization: your careful planning has worked out for you! Your friends have pushed you to the next level, the confidence is there to back it up and your conservative approach has paid off: you\u2019re free to do whatever and go wherever you want. Everything has culminated into this night of big things and everything you need is there. Your skillset is complete to make it a big win. This opportunity is exactly what you\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like this opportunity was hard to get. No. It was *handed* to you. On a silver platter. Right in the middle of your face. You can\u2019t miss it. Point blank. You didn\u2019t ask for it, it just came to you. It came to you and sat on your face. It even showed you the way. This opportunity wasn\u2019t opt-in, it was opt-out! The only thing you have to do, is take it home. Grab the opportunity with both hands and finish the damn job.\n\nYou start dreaming. You\u2019d finally be done living conservatively. New goals were going to be set and those will be your main occupancy in the future. You won\u2019t have to worry about what goals to set in your life, because the life you will be living *was the goal*. What you were saving for, is happening. It\u2019s an all-in bet that you can\u2019t lose: happiness awaits. Not bullshit happiness as in winning the lottery, but real happiness as in finally doing the things and living a life you envied for such a long time.\n\nUnfortunately, your short-sightedness, cockiness, testosteron-laden bullshit and a series of consecutive mistakes \u2013 pardon my French \u2013 fucked it up. You screw yourself royaly, and while you\u2019re doing that, you *know* you\u2019re doing it. The scale of your fuckup is so big it defies any rationality. No amount of words even begin to describe. This is an 8 on the INES scale. It\u2019s worse than the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters combined.\n\nIn the course of the following days, the realization of just how big of a mistake you\u2019ve made is sinking in. It is making you physically ill. The emotional impact is unlike you\u2019ve ever experienced before. You try a few mediocre attempts at fixing it, but you know it\u2019s too late. Your failure and the future that could have been is the only thought on your mind and you\u2019re constantly distracted by it. You could have had everything, you only had to take it home. Just a little bit of effort. That rush you were living on, and philosophy that you can fix anything, is gone. You are still stumped that you thought of yourself as a smart guy and you were still capable of blowing this up.\n\nFast forward to the present time. Now you\u2019re 26. You\u2019ve made several improvements in your life, but the opportunity you had in the past is gone. It will never return. All those years you\u2019ve been saving and preparing are wasted and you simply cannot stop thinking about that fateful day. You recognize that your time here is finite and there\u2019s no way back. It goes as far as willing to re-do your *entire* life, from birth, just to arrive at that same moment in the past and do it right that time. You feel old and time is passing you by. The emotions are like elephants tied to your chest and you have to tow them everywhere with you.\n\nEven a year later, when that fateful date is about to roll by again (it\u2019s etched into your head), you still think about it. And in this period, the feeling is so strong you freeze. You even hope something similar will happen again, but you know that the chances of that are so low, that you are considering using the word impossible. You\u2019re even setting up your agenda to make the weeks surrounding this particlar date to be similar to last year. To make matters worse, your scientific mind knows there\u2019s no correlation between a date in the future and that something like that is going to happen again.\n\nThe question is.

It seems that since then, spiders have been trying their best to get their revenge on me almost (albeit accidentally) consuming their unfortunate cousin.\n\nSo, this morning I woke up, and needed to piss. Common event, right? So I pad along the hallway to the bathroom, lock the door, face the toilet and lift the lid, preparing to sit down (as I am female and we unfortunately our genitalia does not easily allow us to pee standing up). Well luckily I looked first, because under the toilet lid, some huge spindly 8-legged fucker was right their chilling on his web, giving me the look like \"dear lord your ass looks like it'd be fantastic to crawl on/bite/tickle affectionately with my spindly-ass 4\" legs\" so I noped the fuck out and clanged the lid back on the seat. However, I had not yet achieved post-piss status. The golden liquid still had to come out, and I was not willing to get trolled by another goddamn arachnid.\n\nThe sink. She has a drain. I remembered all of 3 years ago, listening to Ke$ha's first ever radio interview (BBC Radio 1, Scott Mills show) which was when I fell in love with her.

I can finally act like my idol of my teenagehood.\n\nI hastily dropped trou, stepped upon the step we keep in the bathroom (I am a lass of an inadequate altitude) and sat down on the sink to do my business.\n\nNow, I am not a heavy girl. I could afford to lose a little weight but I'm probably around 120 pounds. Wateva. The sink cracked while I was mid-urination. Don't know what do.

I step into the bathroom and run it under cold water, only to find out.

{"original_text": "This technically happened yesterday since it 1:30 am here, but I can't sleep because I'm worried. \n\nBefore I start, let me set the scene. It's getting close to 6 on a mildly wet Western North Carolina summer day. Not too much rain, but enough to get the grass wet, and I'm in the really mountainous part of WNC. \n\nSo anyway, after hanging out with a friend of mine, we decide to visit another friend at her house since we're nearby.  I pull up the driveway, see other friends' truck in the way, so I try to go around. The friend I was riding with got \"Wait there's a-\" out just as I heard a *thunk*. \"-ditch there.\" Got-dang it Bobby. So I get out, lo and behold I'm stuck. If my truck had 4 wheel drive, I wouldn't have been as concerned. So I try to go further forward. I hear a *SNAP*. \"Well you broke my pipe, but that's fine.\" Turns out I snapped a ~3 inch PVC pipe (I guess for drainage) and it was now lodged in front of my right front tire.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting.\n\nI leave my truck in neutral, go out to look at the pipe. Think *Oh, I can get that out from under there.* When I do, the whole truck comes rolling forward (remember; mountain country, I'm stuck on a slope.) I dodge the truck, which hits the girl's barn. Neither the barn nor the truck was hurt, but I was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side. After reassuring everyone there I was A-okay, one of the girls called her cousin, who brought a Jeep and a chain. I wriggle my way out of the wire, ever-so carefully step over the wire to make sure I can still have both boys and girls, not just one or the other, and make my way over to help hook things up and such. \n\nLong story short, we get it uphill a little, get another truck involved, get it angled better, cut the fence, and I drive my truck down the adjacent field (what the fence was there to fence off), and everything is okay. I ended up with just as many scratches as the truck. I just got a text to call the girl's mom tomorrow, and I'm worried that she'll tear me a new butthole after this. \n\nTl;dr- My truck went vroom vroom into a ditch.

{"original_text": "Earlier today, I was at the local county fair in the lovely county of Adams in Wisconsin. I was there to enjoy the fair, help out and have a wonderful day. However, later in the afternoon, I found myself in the Rabbit, Chicken, Duck, Goose and Dairy Barn. I was behind a row of rabbit cages with my cousin, which bordered up to the wooden fence divider between the rabbits and dairy cows. \n\nThis beautiful Heifer decided she wanted to poke her head through to the rabbit side  for what I thought, was to get a good scratch behind the ears, and on her bump. She however, had other thoughts. She was just interested in getting the bucket of water on the floor that was meant for watering the rabbits.\n\nWhen I reached down to scratch her, she tolerated it for about 10-15 seconds. At the end of those few seconds, I was looking away speaking to my husband, son, and cousin. All of a sudden, a loud thwack and searing pain in my right hand. I looked down, and she had my hand squished in between her head/head bump and the wooden fence post in the barn. \n\nAfter I got my hand loose, about ten seconds after the initial hit, it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail, as well as the base of the nail was bleeding in the cuticle. My other finger nails felt like I had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can, then push your fingers together game. So as of right now, my hand is still in serious pain, the nail is purple and has some serious blood build up underneath it. As well, all the rest of the blood vessels in the top of my finger have burst so its about three times the size it should be. So this is how I screwed my hand up, by fucking up and mistaking a heifer's want for water, as the want for attention.\n\nTL;DR I fucked up by mistaking a heifer's want for water as a want for attention, petted it, and screwed my hand up pretty bad.

{"original_text": "(Technically this is more of a Three Years Ago I Fucked Up, but I digress...)\n\nBack in the good old school days, we had Friday sport. This term, myself and a group of friends decided to join the Representative Touch Footy team, and we were waiting for the bus to take us to our semi final match.\nMy friend was sitting on the side of the grassy hill where we were waiting, and yelled \"Oi, come over here!\" and patted her lap.\n\nSo, naturally I went over and jumped into her lap, in a weak attempt to crush her legs. Much laughing ensued, which attracted the attention of our other friends. So, we ended up in a pile of about 10, resembling a pile of stacked-up chairs.\n\nOne of my teachers noticed, and walked over to us, shaking his head slightly. Of course, what is the most natural response to seeing a stack of people sitting in each others laps? Push the stack.\nSo, with eight people in front of me (with some pretty serious weight adding up there), we fell over sideways.\n\nAs the laughter increased tenfold, I heard a very faint clicking sound. Feeling my leg tense up, I looked down. Bad move.\n\nAbout five centimetres to the right of my leg was my knee cap, hanging (or levitating as it appeared from my angle) in midair.\n\nSo, after a number of very unladylike expletives and a bit of yelling/screaming, people noticed that my knee cap had attempted to escape my leg and called an ambulance. \nThen the bus showed up.\n\nSo, while my friends went to sport and got their asses kicked by a fellow high school, I sat on the side of the hill with my fucked up leg.\nThe paramedics show up, and ask if they can try and put my knee cap back in place without pain killers. At this point, the extremely light spring breeze which is flowing feels like razor blades cutting into my tendons, so I wasn't exactly keen on this idea.\n\nSo, they picked up the end of my leg and pulled.\n\nI think I punctured an eardrum, screaming. \n\nThey realise that this might not be the best plan, so I'm bundled up onto a stretcher and head off to hospital. Driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list, but at least I've crossed it off?\n\nWhen I arrive at the hospital, I'm finally given the good pain killers (Nitrous oxide for the win, none of that \"Green Whistle\" shit) and the ER physio walks in. It took three people to stabilise me, while he pulled my foot and twisted. Behold, my knee cap FINALLY pops back in! They waited for me to come down of the high of the nitrous before fitting me in a knee brace and crutches.\n\nNote for the wise - a knee brace which holds your leg completely straight, thus making one leg longer than the other, will fuck you over. Worst two weeks ever.\n\nAfter a month, with crutches, a knee brace and some really pleasant taping, physiotherapy and an inability to climb stairs easily, my knee was finally released from its self-induced prison.\n\nI've never sat in that friend's lap again. I also got an A in Geography from that teacher at the end of that term.\n\nEdit: tl;dr: Sat in my friend's lap, douchebag teacher dislocates my knee, kneecap decides to stay locked to the side until I got to the hospital, drugs then two weeks on crutches.", "tldr": " sat in my friend's lap, douchebag teacher dislocates my knee, kneecap decides to stay locked to the side until i got to the hospital, drugs then two weeks on crutches.", "summary_text": "tried to crush my friend's legs, fell over, dislocated my knee cap, had to drive to hospital in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.25454544958677694, "p": 0.28, "r": 0.23333333333333334}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.03773584410110425, "p": 0.041666666666666664, "r": 0.034482758620689655}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.13043477769376202, "p": 0.15, "r": 0.11538461538461539}}], "compression_ratio": 0.042794210195091255, "original_pos_tags": {"(": 4, "RB": 37, "DT": 60, "VBZ": 5, "JJR": 2, "IN": 84, "CD": 9, "NNS": 32, "PRP": 37, "VBD": 36, "RP": 10, ",": 43, "CC": 21, "VBP": 12, ":": 5, ")": 4, "JJ": 28, "NN": 110, "NNP": 13, ".": 34, "TO": 16, "VB": 17, "VBG": 18, "PRP$": 28, "WRB": 2, "``": 2, "''": 2, "VBN": 11, "WDT": 3, "WP": 1, "RBS": 1, "MD": 3, "JJS": 2, "POS": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBN": 2, "TO": 3, "VB": 3, "PRP$": 2, "NN": 6, "POS": 1, "NNS": 1, ",": 3, "VBD": 2, "RB": 1, "IN": 2, "DT": 2, "JJ": 1, ".": 1}}

{"original_text": "First of all, this occurred many years ago, but that doesn't change the amount of fuckuppery that took place.\n\nSo, I was in grade 6 or 7, it was November 11, and my school was having a Remembrance Day assembly. The assembly was typical - poems, a couple videos, etc, and then one of the younger grades had a song that they were going to perform. So they head up to the front of the gym and start doing their thing, and meanwhile I'm sitting on the floor with the rest of my class and I can feel a fart building up.\n\nIn retrospect, it would have been a good idea to unleash the gaseous buildup in my bowels while those younger kids were just beginning to belt out the lyrics to their song, but no, I was positive I could hold it in. \n\nSo I start awkwardly fidgeting around because of the discomfort from holding in the gaseous buildup. This fart was going to be enormous. I had stopped paying any attention to the ongoing song and instead put all of my focus towards holding this bad boy in. It was a valiant effort on my part, but I could tell it was a hopeless battle. I logically decided that I should let it come out while there's loud music being played and everyone is focused on how adorable the singing children are. Just as I am committing to the fart, the song ends.\n\nRemember how this was a Remembrance Day assembly? That means there is no clapping at any point because it would be disrespectful. Once that song ended, it was pure silence. But I had already gave the fart the green light to come out and there was no way to call it back. \n\nOn the bright side of things, it wasn't a wet fart, and nothing more than gas came out. But my god, everyone within a 3 metre radius stared at me, and what is my reaction? I try to laugh it off.

{"original_text": "**WARNING!: WALL OF TEXT WHICH COULD EASILY BE VIEWED AS REALLY FUCKING BORING**\n\nThe background of the relationship is that we had met online and hadn't met yet. He lives 200 miles away from where I live, but my life's rather busy and he doesn't have a job right now (unemployment in his region is over 50%, so I don't blame him). He's a very kind, sweet human being, and I probably would have been lucky to end up with him. Now, I'm not from the country I'm currently studying in, but I would like to end up here eventually. It seemed that the stars had aligned in showing me that there was hope for love here\u2026 Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThere's a huge secessionist movement within a different region (one which neither of us live in), which has been gaining traction over the years, especially with the recent economic collapse. I am a lover of said region; it's the place where I feel the most comfortable in the entire world \u2014 the people, the cuisine, the culture\u2026 all of it just *fits*.\n\nHe, however, does not feel the same way about this region. I already knew that, but it had been bothering me since he had called people from there \"obnoxious sheeps [sic]\", amongst other things. We have always had different communication styles (I'm a fucking loudmouth and he's rather reserved), but we had been making it work. This morning, however, I couldn't hold back some of my worries, and amongst other things, I mentioned how he wants to live in an entirely different country and how I would not.\n\nThe **tl;dr** would be that **he effectively told me I should live in a region he hates and I admire because I clearly don't understand the political climate\u00a0\u2014 in so many words, we should break things off.** However, it's much deeper than that. Apparently, half his family is from said region (and it's the half he dislikes, of course), and he had lived there a very brief period of time. Despite all that, apparently he had never had a bad time there and no one ever did any harm to him. So I really couldn't figure out what his beef was with this place that has always seemed so charming to me.\n\nI don't know what else to say, really. I debated with him my point as best as I could, calling out flaws in his argument about the nature of the secessionist movement and the national identity of the people from that region. For a while I thought he could at least be tolerant of my deep regard for it but\u2026 it would appear that even that was impossible. I got fed up with his ad hominem attacks on me and on the people who live out there, and I told him he can act like a child all he likes, but it doesn't make a whole group of people terrible just for their geographical location.\n\nTbph, I'm a bit numb to it all. In January I had a whirlwind romance which tore me to pieces by the end of it. And having this happen without ever even meeting to see if we're compatible in the real world\u2026 Welp, I'm just done with men for a while. I don't feel anything and my only reaction to this whole thing was to clean my room and wash my sheets in a fervor. He apparently felt awful that he'd lost my respect, but rather I deleted him from all of our sources of communication, which I did so I wouldn't have to deal with his remorse.\n\nI'm not sure if I really fucked up today but\u2026 it would have been nice to at least have *tried* to make things work instead of leaving things off on such a sour note.

This also made me realize that the 15 seconds my step-dad stared into my soul was actually the 15 seconds my step-dad was wondering why in the fuck does this dumbass have a fucking hitler mustache.

{"original_text": "I went on a road trip to visit my mom last week. It was my first time driving to NYC. My map app told me that it was a toll road so I pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty. I'm from the midwest and I've never paid a toll that was higher than maybe $4. I've made the drive up I95 as far north as Baltimore all the way down to GA and I knew there weren't any tolls until I went under the harbor and that one was only a few bucks. I felt prepared.\n\nI pay a couple of tolls totaling $12 and now I'm on the Jersey turnpike. I glanced at my ticket and assume that the $8 I have left should cover my toll just fine. I have not actually zoomed out of my route at all and have just been trusting the map to tell me where I'm going. \n\nTurns out it doesn't even matter because I get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the EZ pass. I don't have one. There's no way to back up or turn around. Cars are honking at me because I'm pretty much panicking at this point. My kids are in the car asking me what's going on and I have no choice but to go forward and hope that I'm not committing a felony or something. \n\nFrom there on it's rapid fire exits and the start of intense traffic going into the city. There's no place to pull over and pull more cash, nor did it even occur to me to do so because by now I'm no longer on an Interstate. However, a few miles down the road and there's another tollbooth and they want $12, which, of course, I don't have because nothing in my years of Interstate travel through middle America has prepared me for how much tolls are on the East Coast. She waves me through and I feel like crying. I have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as I did then. \n\nFast forward to today and I get a bright orange envelope in the mail. It's an EZ pass citation. Not only do I owe them $13 (!) for the toll, but I'm charged an extra $50 as a fine. I'm praying that the other toll I owe doesn't have the same fee added to it. \n\nIronically enough, on the way home I accidentally picked a route consisting of state roads and didn't realize it at first. I literally paid $3 in tolls and shaved 2 hours off the trip by avoiding backed up metro traffic. But guess who had $150 in my purse just waiting for a tollbooth to materialize on the horizon?\n\nTL;DR Gas to get from GA to NY round trip was around $200.

{"original_text": "Okay, so I just got off work today and I had to tell this story somewhere. I work in a call center for a cable company for their tech support. Today I got a specific call about something along the lines of \"When I open internet explorer all that comes up is a giant white screen and I can never close out of the pages\"\n\nAt first I thought, maybe he hit f11 and it cause the browser to go full screen. In the end I figured out he was actually using the new windows 8 operating system and just didn't know how to navigate it whatsoever. I'm not an expert on windows 8 by any means, but I thought I would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out even though it was out of my support boundaries.

He was an older man, and 5 minutes into the call he let me know \"how beautiful of a voice\" I have. Asked me my age and where I'm located (basically any information I was allowed to give out.) He repeated my name multiple times and just kept talking about how pretty my voice apparently is on the phone. I didn't think much of it, until we got to me showing him how to use his OS. \n\nOver the phone I talked him through typing in an address in the actual address bar at the bottom of the page on windows 8 and prompted him to type in a code which would allow me to remotely access his computer and navigate it/type stuff on it/use a highlighter/etc in order to show him how to use the computer. First things first, let's delete all those open tabs..\n\nLucky me I guess, half those tabs were porn. Straight up porn. My favorite had to have been the \"daddy daughter massage play\". Definitely had me rethinking those questions I answered earlier in the call.

Also, forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker.\n\n  So I\u00b4m a nervous guy,and this week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because I had to buy some groceries on my apartment that I didn\u00b4t account for. Now, I dont have a debit card so I can't get money from my savings that easily. So naturally I don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and I try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money, which I end up missmanaging, and by friday morning I had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it. As I was pretty much bankrupt and I had to attend to some classes saturday morning, I give up and end up asking my parents to send me money. At this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt I am and how likely it is that money wont come on time and I\u00b4ll find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning, so I was not paying attention while I took the bus back home.\n\nThe bus drivers where I live are pretty much insane, and policemen apparently dont care about this, so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100km/h instead of 40km/h. In this moment I realize I will miss my stop, and there are no set stops for the bus on my country, outside of the capital city, so I yell at the guy to stop, of course he can\u00b4t go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street. The guy slows down to 30km/h by the moment he gets to my stop, and I for some reason thought I could be a badass and jump/run out of the bus whithout fall damage cause well, my mind was all over the place about money, so I jumped from a moving bus, at 30km/h and the inevitable happens, I wreck my ankle like a total dumbass, and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth, in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows. Out of pure shame I stand up and signal them that I'm ok and walk all the way to my apartment (approx 200m plus straircases) I lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit.\n\nFast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon (a small melon), and I can't bear the pain. Luckily this is also the moment that my cousin (who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me) gets to the apartment so I ask him to get me to the hospital. Long story short, I had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be, which earns me a cast, a $300 bill with my cousin, and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors I end up owing exams, and to my already pissed parents.\n\nTL;DR: Jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months.", "tldr": " jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months.", "summary_text": "ran out of money, jumped out of a moving bus at 30km/h and ended up on the floor with gravel on my mouth and my ankle.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.275862064019025, "p": 0.3076923076923077, "r": 0.25}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.14285713791454097, "p": 0.16, "r": 0.12903225806451613}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.26086956025519853, "p": 0.2857142857142857, "r": 0.24}}], "compression_ratio": 0.04039712427250942, "original_pos_tags": {"RB": 36, "PRP": 53, "VBD": 23, "NN": 103, "CC": 28, "JJ": 24, ",": 30, "VBP": 24, ".": 15, "DT": 59, "IN": 74, "VBZ": 12, "PRP$": 24, "NNS": 19, "RBR": 2, "TO": 29, "VB": 29, "MD": 5, "NNP": 6, "VBG": 11, "WDT": 3, "RP": 6, "WRB": 3, "VBN": 8, "CD": 10, "EX": 1, "PDT": 3, "(": 3, ")": 3, "WP": 1, "$": 1, ":": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBD": 3, "IN": 8, "NN": 6, ",": 1, "DT": 2, "VBG": 1, "CD": 1, "CC": 2, "RB": 1, "PRP$": 2, ".": 1}}

I came, many, many times.\n\nUnfortunately... I fell asleep after cumming. During a really intense, really detailed sex scene.\n\nAnd what do I awake to?\n\nMy mother. Perched at the side of my bed. Holding my laptop. Staring at the screen. She turns to me.\n\n\"Throwaway956...\" My life flashes before my eyes. My heart pounds. I think I'm having a heart attack. I might have just evacuated my bowels. I could die right now. I wish I was. \"Your laptop...\" FUCKSTICKS. \"Is very hot.\" I do not feel relief. I do not. Because she's logged in to my account. Which, last I knew, had said kinky detailed intense sex scene on it involving me, a woman with six lactating breasts, with the body and face of an anthropomorphic dog, and a dick that could more appropriately be called a third leg, pounding and being pounded by various very kinky creatures, and being transformed as a result of said fornication.\n\nShe hasn't said a word about it. But I have noted a large rise in 'joking' \"Sure you aren't gay?\" quips from both parents. I can not look either parent in the eyes, despite the fact I'm a legal adult who has a pretty much legal right to look at porn.\n\n**TODAY. I. FUCKED. UP.**\n\n\nAnd, link for the interested, to Flexible Survival: http://blog.flexiblesurvival.com/\n\nAnd, also, this shall be a public throwaway, for all you nice people. The password is \"throwaway\". I hope I spelt it right while I was typing it into the register screen.\n\nEdit: Yup, he spelt the password right!\n\nEdit 2: Changed the password-I'm not a nice person.
