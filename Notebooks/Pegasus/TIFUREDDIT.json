{"original_text": "This actually happened a couple of years ago. I grew up in Germany where I went to a German secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). My school was named after Anne Frank and we had a club that I was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about Anne Franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, Hitler, the Third Reich and that whole Spiel. Basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. \n\nThis was my last year at school and I already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. I was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. We start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about Anne Frank and the Third Reich? You'd be surprised how much they know. Anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. After the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. One group watches a short movie about Anne Frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. Then the groups switch. \n\nI'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and I take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. I'm going down the list when I come to the name Sandra (name changed). A kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in Germany, pipes up. \n\nNow keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). This being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for German standards) Bavaria, I was confused. I looked down at the list again making sure I had read the name right. Look back up at the kid. \n\nMe: \"You're Sandra?\"\n\nKid: \"Yep.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, sorry. *Thinking the kid must be from somewhere where Sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* Where are you from? I've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.\"\n\nThe class starts laughing. Sandra gets really quiet. \"I am a girl...\" she says. Some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met Sandra. I feel so sorry and stupid. I get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. We watch the movie in silence. After the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place I apologised to Sandra. I felt so incredibly terrible, I still do to this day. Throughout the rest of the day I heard lots of whispers about Sandra. I tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip I had set in motion.\n\nSandra, if you're out there, I am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. I hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. Don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. I'm sorry I probably made that day hell for you. I'm sorry for my ignorance.\n\n**TL;DR: Confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. Kids are mean.

{"original_text": "It was last October, but I'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  \n\nAfter my mom died from cancer last year, I started looking for my estranged father.  I had only known him for a short time when I was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  I never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so I didn't push her for information about him.  I figured he didn't care about us.\n\nI had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and I didn't have an address with which to search.  After her death, I felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that I have a beautiful little girl.  It felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.\nI googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  I called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since I'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  It wasn't.\n\nI had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  He told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  He said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  My mom was the best woman I've ever known).\n\nSo, we started talking and skyping.  We spent a lot of time learning about each other. Knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but I tried to believe that people can change for the better.  \n\nHe was exactly everything I needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  Eventually, I told him that I loved him after months of talking with him.  He was over-the-moon.\n\nFast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  This is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that I sound like an ass.  I say this because I don't have a precise reason or event that I can point to as to why I don't trust him.  Why he actually makes me really nervous.\n\nMy dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  He doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  He doesn't give personal space and, when I spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while I was sleeping.  He said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but I really felt uncomfortable with it.  I couldn't sleep and was so glad that I didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.\n\nHe also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  I said \"no\" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  It wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  \nI've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  I have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  \n\nDuring the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  I was so grateful for it that I kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  He actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if I cited my daughter and husband as reasons that I needed to chill with the phone.  He never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  He also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  \n\nAgain, I know people can change, but at this point, I find myself wanting less contact with him.  The idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  I don't want to hurt him, but I just can't trust him.  I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.\n\nThank you for reading and I sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very Happy Father's Day!\n\nETA:  TL;DR  I found my estranged Dad, thought I loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind.\n\n", "tldr": "  i found my estranged dad, thought i loved him after getting to know him, got to know him better and changed my mind.", "summary_text": "i met my dad for the first time in my entire life and i feel like an ass because i don't know why i don't trust him.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.27999999503200007, "p": 0.25925925925925924, "r": 0.30434782608695654}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.1999999950500001, "p": 0.18181818181818182, "r": 0.2222222222222222}}], "compression_ratio": 0.027300541303836197, "original_pos_tags": {"PRP": 139, "VBD": 75, "JJ": 51, "NNP": 8, ",": 32, "CC": 41, "VBP": 17, "VBG": 30, "DT": 41, "NN": 89, "IN": 101, "RBS": 2, ".": 46, "PRP$": 29, "RB": 63, "VBN": 11, "WRB": 8, "CD": 3, "JJR": 3, "MD": 17, "VB": 40, "NNS": 20, "WDT": 4, "TO": 22, "JJS": 2, "RP": 1, "(": 1, ")": 1, "VBZ": 9, ":": 3, "``": 1, "''": 1, "RBR": 1, "PDT": 1, "POS": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"NN": 6, "VBD": 1, "PRP$": 2, "IN": 4, "DT": 2, "JJ": 3, "CC": 1, "VBP": 3, "RB": 2, "VB": 2, "WRB": 1, "NNS": 1, "PRP": 1, ".": 1}}

{"original_text": "Today I was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival.

The friend I was riding with got \"Wait there's a-\" out just as I heard a *thunk*. \"-ditch there.\" Got-dang it Bobby. So I get out, lo and behold I'm stuck. If my truck had 4 wheel drive, I wouldn't have been as concerned. So I try to go further forward. I hear a *SNAP*. \"Well you broke my pipe, but that's fine.\" Turns out I snapped a ~3 inch PVC pipe (I guess for drainage) and it was now lodged in front of my right front tire.\n\nNow here's where it gets interesting.\n\nI leave my truck in neutral, go out to look at the pipe. Think *Oh, I can get that out from under there.* When I do, the whole truck comes rolling forward (remember; mountain country, I'm stuck on a slope.) I dodge the truck, which hits the girl's barn. Neither the barn nor the truck was hurt, but I was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side. After reassuring everyone there I was A-okay, one of the girls called her cousin, who brought a Jeep and a chain. I wriggle my way out of the wire, ever-so carefully step over the wire to make sure I can still have both boys and girls, not just one or the other, and make my way over to help hook things up and such. \n\nLong story short, we get it uphill a little, get another truck involved, get it angled better, cut the fence, and I drive my truck down the adjacent field (what the fence was there to fence off), and everything is okay. I ended up with just as many scratches as the truck. I just got a text to call the girl's mom tomorrow, and I'm worried that she'll tear me a new butthole after this. \n\nTl;dr- My truck went vroom vroom into a ditch. I tried to get it out, and it tried to kill me.

{"original_text": "Earlier today, I was at the local county fair in the lovely county of Adams in Wisconsin. I was there to enjoy the fair, help out and have a wonderful day. However, later in the afternoon, I found myself in the Rabbit, Chicken, Duck, Goose and Dairy Barn. I was behind a row of rabbit cages with my cousin, which bordered up to the wooden fence divider between the rabbits and dairy cows. \n\nThis beautiful Heifer decided she wanted to poke her head through to the rabbit side  for what I thought, was to get a good scratch behind the ears, and on her bump. She however, had other thoughts. She was just interested in getting the bucket of water on the floor that was meant for watering the rabbits.\n\nWhen I reached down to scratch her, she tolerated it for about 10-15 seconds. At the end of those few seconds, I was looking away speaking to my husband, son, and cousin. All of a sudden, a loud thwack and searing pain in my right hand. I looked down, and she had my hand squished in between her head/head bump and the wooden fence post in the barn. \n\nAfter I got my hand loose, about ten seconds after the initial hit, it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail, as well as the base of the nail was bleeding in the cuticle. My other finger nails felt like I had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can, then push your fingers together game. So as of right now, my hand is still in serious pain, the nail is purple and has some serious blood build up underneath it. As well, all the rest of the blood vessels in the top of my finger have burst so its about three times the size it should be. So this is how I screwed my hand up, by fucking up and mistaking a heifer's want for water, as the want for attention.\n\nTL;DR I fucked up by mistaking a heifer's want for water as a want for attention, petted it, and screwed my hand up pretty bad.

{"original_text": "(Technically this is more of a Three Years Ago I Fucked Up, but I digress...)\n\nBack in the good old school days, we had Friday sport. This term, myself and a group of friends decided to join the Representative Touch Footy team, and we were waiting for the bus to take us to our semi final match.\nMy friend was sitting on the side of the grassy hill where we were waiting, and yelled \"Oi, come over here!\" and patted her lap.\n\nSo, naturally I went over and jumped into her lap, in a weak attempt to crush her legs. Much laughing ensued, which attracted the attention of our other friends. So, we ended up in a pile of about 10, resembling a pile of stacked-up chairs.\n\nOne of my teachers noticed, and walked over to us, shaking his head slightly. Of course, what is the most natural response to seeing a stack of people sitting in each others laps? Push the stack.\nSo, with eight people in front of me (with some pretty serious weight adding up there), we fell over sideways.\n\nAs the laughter increased tenfold, I heard a very faint clicking sound. Feeling my leg tense up, I looked down. Bad move.\n\nAbout five centimetres to the right of my leg was my knee cap, hanging (or levitating as it appeared from my angle) in midair.\n\nSo, after a number of very unladylike expletives and a bit of yelling/screaming, people noticed that my knee cap had attempted to escape my leg and called an ambulance. \nThen the bus showed up.\n\nSo, while my friends went to sport and got their asses kicked by a fellow high school, I sat on the side of the hill with my fucked up leg.\nThe paramedics show up, and ask if they can try and put my knee cap back in place without pain killers. At this point, the extremely light spring breeze which is flowing feels like razor blades cutting into my tendons, so I wasn't exactly keen on this idea.\n\nSo, they picked up the end of my leg and pulled.\n\nI think I punctured an eardrum, screaming. \n\nThey realise that this might not be the best plan, so I'm bundled up onto a stretcher and head off to hospital. Driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list, but at least I've crossed it off?\n\nWhen I arrive at the hospital, I'm finally given the good pain killers (Nitrous oxide for the win, none of that \"Green Whistle\" shit) and the ER physio walks in. It took three people to stabilise me, while he pulled my foot and twisted. Behold, my knee cap FINALLY pops back in!

{"original_text": "**WARNING!: WALL OF TEXT WHICH COULD EASILY BE VIEWED AS REALLY FUCKING BORING**\n\nThe background of the relationship is that we had met online and hadn't met yet. He lives 200 miles away from where I live, but my life's rather busy and he doesn't have a job right now (unemployment in his region is over 50%, so I don't blame him). He's a very kind, sweet human being, and I probably would have been lucky to end up with him. Now, I'm not from the country I'm currently studying in, but I would like to end up here eventually. It seemed that the stars had aligned in showing me that there was hope for love here\u2026 Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThere's a huge secessionist movement within a different region (one which neither of us live in), which has been gaining traction over the years, especially with the recent economic collapse. I am a lover of said region; it's the place where I feel the most comfortable in the entire world \u2014 the people, the cuisine, the culture\u2026 all of it just *fits*.\n\nHe, however, does not feel the same way about this region. I already knew that, but it had been bothering me since he had called people from there \"obnoxious sheeps [sic]\", amongst other things. We have always had different communication styles (I'm a fucking loudmouth and he's rather reserved), but we had been making it work. This morning, however, I couldn't hold back some of my worries, and amongst other things, I mentioned how he wants to live in an entirely different country and how I would not.\n\nThe **tl;dr** would be that **he effectively told me I should live in a region he hates and I admire because I clearly don't understand the political climate\u00a0\u2014 in so many words, we should break things off.** However, it's much deeper than that. Apparently, half his family is from said region (and it's the half he dislikes, of course), and he had lived there a very brief period of time. Despite all that, apparently he had never had a bad time there and no one ever did any harm to him. So I really couldn't figure out what his beef was with this place that has always seemed so charming to me.\n\nI don't know what else to say, really. I debated with him my point as best as I could, calling out flaws in his argument about the nature of the secessionist movement and the national identity of the people from that region. For a while I thought he could at least be tolerant of my deep regard for it but\u2026 it would appear that even that was impossible. I got fed up with his ad hominem attacks on me and on the people who live out there, and I told him he can act like a child all he likes, but it doesn't make a whole group of people terrible just for their geographical location.\n\nTbph, I'm a bit numb to it all. In January I had a whirlwind romance which tore me to pieces by the end of it. And having this happen without ever even meeting to see if we're compatible in the real world\u2026 Welp, I'm just done with men for a while. I don't feel anything and my only reaction to this whole thing was to clean my room and wash my sheets in a fervor. He apparently felt awful that he'd lost my respect, but rather I deleted him from all of our sources of communication, which I did so I wouldn't have to deal with his remorse.\n\nI'm not sure if I really fucked up today but\u2026 it would have been nice to at least have *tried* to make things work instead of leaving things off on such a sour note.

(btw fuck you grammer nazi's because i dont care about my punctuation) I decide that im going to be crafty...so i grab it and sneak behind my mother and yell loudly that i was the salad ninja and stole a bite. Now as this happens she turns and looks at me with dissapointment  in her eyes as she yells \"stay off my fu-.......\" and at that moment she looks up at me and gasps that she cant breathe and needs help. so i do what i think the fucking Heimlich maneuver is, which wasnt pretty at all, and fail horribly and start yelling for her to breathe because it was all i could think to do and this woke my step-dad. at this moment i realized she was coughing which means she was breathing to some extent. my stepdad rolls in the kitchen and tries to pull off his version of the Heimlich maneuver as well which also wasnt pretty at all. and after some trial and error he looks at me realizing she is breathing as well sort of saying \"what the hell are we in here doing as far as i know shes fine.\" then he looks back down at her only to look up again and stare into my eyes as if he is looking at my soul or something for at least 15 seconds which felt like a year or something. then my wife comes down the stairs and she starts freaking out and calls the ambulance and i realize why she was shocked as i saw the puddle of blood coming from my mothers mouth. The squad showed up and they asked questions like her name and other various things a squad would ask before packing her up in the gurney and rolling out to the hospital. my step-dad left shortly after and i havnt seen or heard from them yet.

So since i was going to be the first person she sees at 10 AM tomorrow morning i thought i would shave my head and all of my facial hair except for a hitler mustache and completely act like it was normal and this is how i look all the time. \n\nOf course i forget about this completely as it was several hours before and no one else had known about it. This also made me realize that the 15 seconds my step-dad stared into my soul was actually the 15 seconds my step-dad was wondering why in the fuck does this dumbass have a fucking hitler mustache. As i have said i hadnt talked to anyone about it and no one knew anything about it, nor have i talked to anyone since it happened and im sure im going to hear about his when they all get home. Im not really sure how to explain a hitler mustache to anyone, if anyone has ideas im open for them. However i definitely would say that i fucked up hardcore and this isnt going to be a good convo at all...fml.\n\nTL:DR: I damn near killed my mom while being the \"salad ninja\" and had to explain what had happened to the paramedics while having a hitler mustache.", "tldr": " i damn near killed my mom while being the \"salad ninja\" and had to explain what had happened to the paramedics while having a hitler mustache.", "summary_text": "tried to be a salad ninja and save my mother's life and now my step-fathers half mexican daughter is coming to see her father for the first time in her life.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.21052631082794718, "p": 0.1935483870967742, "r": 0.23076923076923078}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.16666666170138905, "p": 0.15384615384615385, "r": 0.18181818181818182}}], "compression_ratio": 0.042663043478260866, "original_pos_tags": {"NNP": 6, "RB": 52, "IN": 91, "NN": 118, "MD": 7, "VB": 38, "TO": 26, "PRP$": 28, "JJ": 47, "DT": 59, "``": 5, "''": 5, "CC": 39, "VBZ": 26, "VBG": 24, "VBP": 26, ".": 27, "VBD": 31, "NNS": 22, "CD": 7, ",": 6, "PRP": 40, "EX": 1, "(": 2, "POS": 1, ")": 2, ":": 8, "RP": 8, "WP": 4, "WDT": 4, "JJS": 2, "WRB": 5, "VBN": 10, "RBR": 1, "PDT": 1}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBN": 1, "TO": 2, "VB": 3, "DT": 2, "JJ": 4, "NN": 7, "CC": 2, "PRP$": 4, "POS": 1, "RB": 1, "NNS": 1, "VBZ": 1, "VBG": 1, "IN": 2, ".": 1}}

Now Cathy has burns on about 90% of her body which is very unfortunate, but Cathy is also a huge bitch. Cathy was working transfer(basically taking hamburger patties and putting them on the buns). So you can imagine what happens next... Cathy is waiting for me to finish up a couple of patties but I know they have another half a minute or so until she should take them. Then all of a sudden a wild order appears, I think it was grilled onions or jalapenos and some grilled chicken. so I throw these down real quick and start to go to town. In the process of this Cathy tells me that she needs my meat. I tell her to give me a couple seconds, but that wasn't quick enough for her. She decides in horrible fashion that shes just going to grab it off the grill. So in my blatant ignorance I say \"I hope you burn yourself.\" The mistake I just made quickly pours over me, but before i have time to correct myself and apologize she replies with \" I already have.\" I immediately feel the daggers of empathy go through my heart, and try to apologize, but the damage is done and I realize that everyone around me is just staring.

{"original_text": "I went on a road trip to visit my mom last week. It was my first time driving to NYC. My map app told me that it was a toll road so I pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty. I'm from the midwest and I've never paid a toll that was higher than maybe $4. I've made the drive up I95 as far north as Baltimore all the way down to GA and I knew there weren't any tolls until I went under the harbor and that one was only a few bucks. I felt prepared.\n\nI pay a couple of tolls totaling $12 and now I'm on the Jersey turnpike. I glanced at my ticket and assume that the $8 I have left should cover my toll just fine. I have not actually zoomed out of my route at all and have just been trusting the map to tell me where I'm going. \n\nTurns out it doesn't even matter because I get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the EZ pass. I don't have one. There's no way to back up or turn around. Cars are honking at me because I'm pretty much panicking at this point. My kids are in the car asking me what's going on and I have no choice but to go forward and hope that I'm not committing a felony or something. \n\nFrom there on it's rapid fire exits and the start of intense traffic going into the city. There's no place to pull over and pull more cash, nor did it even occur to me to do so because by now I'm no longer on an Interstate. However, a few miles down the road and there's another tollbooth and they want $12, which, of course, I don't have because nothing in my years of Interstate travel through middle America has prepared me for how much tolls are on the East Coast. She waves me through and I feel like crying. I have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as I did then. \n\nFast forward to today and I get a bright orange envelope in the mail. It's an EZ pass citation. Not only do I owe them $13 (!) for the toll, but I'm charged an extra $50 as a fine. I'm praying that the other toll I owe doesn't have the same fee added to it. \n\nIronically enough, on the way home I accidentally picked a route consisting of state roads and didn't realize it at first. I literally paid $3 in tolls and shaved 2 hours off the trip by avoiding backed up metro traffic. But guess who had $150 in my purse just waiting for a tollbooth to materialize on the horizon?\n\nTL;DR Gas to get from GA to NY round trip was around $200.

{"original_text": "Okay, so I just got off work today and I had to tell this story somewhere. I work in a call center for a cable company for their tech support. Today I got a specific call about something along the lines of \"When I open internet explorer all that comes up is a giant white screen and I can never close out of the pages\"\n\nAt first I thought, maybe he hit f11 and it cause the browser to go full screen. In the end I figured out he was actually using the new windows 8 operating system and just didn't know how to navigate it whatsoever. I'm not an expert on windows 8 by any means, but I thought I would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out even though it was out of my support boundaries. This guy was bounced from line to line and no one was willing to help him, so why wouldn't I make his day just a bit better by doing him this one favor?\n\nWell, for one, this guy was a bit strange. He was an older man, and 5 minutes into the call he let me know \"how beautiful of a voice\" I have. Asked me my age and where I'm located (basically any information I was allowed to give out.) He repeated my name multiple times and just kept talking about how pretty my voice apparently is on the phone. I didn't think much of it, until we got to me showing him how to use his OS. \n\nOver the phone I talked him through typing in an address in the actual address bar at the bottom of the page on windows 8 and prompted him to type in a code which would allow me to remotely access his computer and navigate it/type stuff on it/use a highlighter/etc in order to show him how to use the computer. First things first, let's delete all those open tabs..\n\nLucky me I guess, half those tabs were porn. Straight up porn. My favorite had to have been the \"daddy daughter massage play\". Definitely had me rethinking those questions I answered earlier in the call. Anyways, when The tabs opened I heard him on the other line say \"Oh, hello there!\" and I about died laughing. \n\nThe rest of the call was super awkward, and now I'm pretty sure I have a phobia of old men calling me for technical support.

{"original_text": "Technically it was not today but last friday, hope you forgive me there. Also, forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker.\n\n  So I\u00b4m a nervous guy,and this week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because I had to buy some groceries on my apartment that I didn\u00b4t account for. Now, I dont have a debit card so I can't get money from my savings that easily. So naturally I don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and I try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money, which I end up missmanaging, and by friday morning I had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it. As I was pretty much bankrupt and I had to attend to some classes saturday morning, I give up and end up asking my parents to send me money. At this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt I am and how likely it is that money wont come on time and I\u00b4ll find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning, so I was not paying attention while I took the bus back home.\n\nThe bus drivers where I live are pretty much insane, and policemen apparently dont care about this, so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100km/h instead of 40km/h. In this moment I realize I will miss my stop, and there are no set stops for the bus on my country, outside of the capital city, so I yell at the guy to stop, of course he can\u00b4t go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street. The guy slows down to 30km/h by the moment he gets to my stop, and I for some reason thought I could be a badass and jump/run out of the bus whithout fall damage cause well, my mind was all over the place about money, so I jumped from a moving bus, at 30km/h and the inevitable happens, I wreck my ankle like a total dumbass, and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth, in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows. Out of pure shame I stand up and signal them that I'm ok and walk all the way to my apartment (approx 200m plus straircases) I lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit.\n\nFast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon (a small melon), and I can't bear the pain. Luckily this is also the moment that my cousin (who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me) gets to the apartment so I ask him to get me to the hospital. Long story short, I had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be, which earns me a cast, a $300 bill with my cousin, and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors I end up owing exams, and to my already pissed parents.\n\nTL;DR: Jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months.", "tldr": " jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months.", "summary_text": "ran out of money, jumped out of a moving bus at 30km/h and ended up on the floor with gravel on my mouth and my ankle.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.275862064019025, "p": 0.3076923076923077, "r": 0.25}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.14285713791454097, "p": 0.16, "r": 0.12903225806451613}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.26086956025519853, "p": 0.2857142857142857, "r": 0.24}}], "compression_ratio": 0.04039712427250942, "original_pos_tags": {"RB": 36, "PRP": 53, "VBD": 23, "NN": 103, "CC": 28, "JJ": 24, ",": 30, "VBP": 24, ".": 15, "DT": 59, "IN": 74, "VBZ": 12, "PRP$": 24, "NNS": 19, "RBR": 2, "TO": 29, "VB": 29, "MD": 5, "NNP": 6, "VBG": 11, "WDT": 3, "RP": 6, "WRB": 3, "VBN": 8, "CD": 10, "EX": 1, "PDT": 3, "(": 3, ")": 3, "WP": 1, "$": 1, ":": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBD": 3, "IN": 8, "NN": 6, ",": 1, "DT": 2, "VBG": 1, "CD": 1, "CC": 2, "RB": 1, "PRP$": 2, ".": 1}}

I was hesitant because I never really eat there (I'm not big on Taco Bell, sue me).

We're all starving so my girlfriend suggests Arby's. I say why the fuck not cuz it's been a while as well and I get a chicken, bacon and swiss sandwich and a chocolate shake. Fucking delicious by the way. So we get back to my house and all is well. My girlfriend and I both smoke so throughout the day and night we are smoking as well. \n\nNow fast forward again to about 11, I start getting cramps in my lower abdomen, like knife stabbing.

The alcohol takes over and he agrees, putting the headsooth down his jeans. He then throws it to me, and as not one to back down from an agreement, I lathered that shit on. Really pasted it.

No longer than 20 seconds later the slight tingling in my balls turned to a furious burning sensation, to which I ran upstairs in agony. I run to the nearest sink and pull out my manhood, and what do I see? My balls, shining like a beacon, red as a London bus. I hear a scream from downstairs, and the last guy runs upstairs screaming. So there we are, three guys, luckily with three sinks in separate rooms, washing our balls. The pain was unbearable, I thought I was going to pass out. It was a hybrid of burning/aching/stinging in the most sensitive of areas. I felt like I needed to piss, shit and just die all at once.

After some gentle encouragement from my girlfriend, I agreed that I really did need to get back on it and go back to working out.\n\nCue yesterday, first day back to the gym. I had lost my old lock but I had the one from my locker at my last job so I just brought that with me. I show up, get changed, and work out.\n\nWhen I get done with my workout, I go back in the locker room, grab my soap, a towel, and underwear, lock my locker and go shower.\n\nI finished my shower, walked out and up to my locker, and my heart sank. You can probably imagine why.\n\nMy old lock was a combination lock. The one from my locker at work was a key lock. My keys were inside my locker.\n\nThere I stood, wet, cold, and in my boxers, staring at my locker and the empty locker room and contemplating my next move.\n\nAfter a few minutes alone in the locker room, I realized nobody else was going to be able to help me (because nobody else was in there), so I braved the journey from the locker room to the front desk.\n\nHere's where it gets worse -- the entire gym is one big room, with mirrors around the perimeter. If you're in the gym, people can see you.

As if my luck wasn't bad enough, now somebody from the other gender was the one I had to ask for help, in front of god and everybody, in my underwear.\n\nMuch to my relief, the gym has a set of bolt cutters which she lent to me so I could go get my locker open. I trekked across the gym, now looking more ridiculous than before, in my underwear, holding a bolt cutter.\n\nI made it back to my locker, cut the lock, got dressed and walked back up. I returned the bolt cutter and made it a priority to get the fuck outta there as fast as I could. Hopefully nobody that's in there tonight was there last night, but chances are I won't get so lucky.\n\n\ntl;dr: **I locked my keys in my locker, including the key for my lock.

{"original_text": "This is going to start like most of these with a \"this wasn't today but whatever\". Just shut up, y'all want to here a good story. So, me and my two best mates are out in Zante. First ever lads holiday. If you've seen the Inbetweeners film, that was roughly our expectations. And it delivered. \n\nSo I had never been sick from alcohol until the first night. Zante changed that. Apologies to Megan, our rep, who received the blessing of my first ever tactical chunder. That's what you get when we arrive at 8:00 and we have dropped the bags and in a huge group on the way to the strip at 8:02. So yeah, shit had gone down, one mate nailed the grimmest effort of a girl in our whole resort and we carried on. \n\nFast forward to the third night, this is where I really fucked up. We waited fairly late to go out, plenty of predrinks, best digs on and ready for whatever the fuck that night would bring us. So we went slightly mad, laughing gas, headfuckers and erect nipples went down and down for a while. We followed the reps group and ended up in a bar/ club thing. At this point I was on the verge between loving it and cresting the peak. My confidence was huge, my banter and charm (I thought) was top notch and was chatting up some skirt. Then my boys came over and told me that they entered my fucked ass in one of the drinking games. And, in case you have never been on this type of holiday before, that's code for torture involving alcohol. \n\nSo it's me versus this girl, and I'm genuinely struggling to comprehend the instructions from the rep over the huge PA system in the club, but there is a load of drinks on a tray to the side and a barstool in front of me. That's what a state I was already.  I knew this was bad. So the idea was (from my memory), shot of vodka 10 spins around the bar stool, 10 push ups, 10 star jumps and there was 4 shots. Then the same thing but with a pint (!) of sex on the beach. Shit son. Did this in a completely retarded fashion, then we had to find 10 members of the opposite sex to kiss and run back. Done. Some of the girls even volunteered, but most, I sort of just grabbed their face. Then another shot of vod and one last excersize round. Whoah nelly. \n\nAs we got to the final big club where a DJ was playing, I was totally hating it. Felt just awful, could not control myself and I wanted out of this drunken stupor. My buddies paid for me to go to the VIP lounge so I could sit down. Sat down for maybe one or two minutes. Could not handle it. The music, the room spin, Jesus this is awful. Ran outside. Projectile paint job on a car parked outside the club. Sat on the curb and vomited some more all over myself and the car. Passed out. Loads of people tyres to wake me up, apparently. Would not move. I went to a place then that I never want to go to again. If I had a gun, I would have shot myself immediately. And I'm very much not suicidal. I wanted out. I wanted to die if it stopped my being this goddamn drunk. Wanted to cry. Saw an ambulance pulling up. Got in. \n\nWoke up in the middle of the night on a drip, doctors and nurses standing around me. Was on a drip. Went back to sleep just to get out of this nightmare. I could not face reality. \n\nWoke up the next morning, no headache and far more sober, still with the drip attached. Found my way to the hospital toilet, trailing the drip behind. Found something else down there too (reset the counter everyone). Yup. Had done that overnight at some point. At this point I was just greatfull to be alive and not drunk. \n\nTo shorten this part up, I chatted to the nurses and they basically said I owed about \u20ac500. As luck would have it I paid for travel insurance and the nurses said that we would agree to say I just had a stomach bug from the water, otherwise if there is alcohol involved they won't pay.  \n\nThis ended with me banging on the door of my bros hotel room. Tears of joy in their eyes, all I could say was, \"I need travel insurance, hotel documents and out flight ticket home\". Those words are now legend amongst us. \n\nThat's my tale. Sorry if I wrote it like shit of if it was boring. It was one of the worst moments of my life, no actually THE worst (I have had a lucky life so far in terms of relatives passing etc). And if someone can get a laugh out of it and/or learn from it, then it wasn't such a waste of time. \n\nTLDR: I don't blame you, that was one hell of a wall of text.

{"original_text": "This actually happened a while ago, but so did everything else on this sub. This fuck up happened whilst I was still in highschool. I lived very far away from my highschool, so during my senior year I lived with my grandmother to save money on petrol. As you can imagine, my grandmother is not an avid user of the Internet, but I am. I implored her to change to a shaped plan. A shaped plan is where instead of charging you extra when you go over your data allowance, they slow your throughput with no further charges.\n\nShe refused, because technology is scary. If she had just taken my advice, I wouldn't be writing this post. Highschool was a very frustrating time for me; I grew hair where there was no hair before, and I felt the urges that all teenage boys feel. My room had a computer in it, and I consistently went over our data allowance with pornography every single month that I lived with my grandmother. Since the allowance was so restrictive, I chose to download and store all of the porn videos locally for later use, in a single folder called something along the lines of \"Biology Homework,\" because teenagers like to think that they're clever when they're really not. I even cleared the browser history, because obviously I did.\n\nFrustrated, (but in a different, angrier way) my grandmother called her ISP to dispute a huge bill that my penis had accrued (*.. Ladies*). The ISP emailed her my download history, which included a lot of visits to various tube-porn sites. My grandmother, not fully understanding that her 'download limit' encompasses page views as well as downloaded files, decided to search through all of my folders, and yes, she found lots and lots of my dirty, **dirty** porn.\n\nNow, my grandmother isn't stupid. Obviously a teenage boy is going to look at Internet porn. She opened one of the aforementioned locally stored videos. She was not prepared for what she saw. My grandmother was married at 19, so she hasn't exactly been around the block. What she saw was in an entirely different suburb. When I got home from school she confronted me. I owned up to everything, because I didn't think that it was that big of a deal, but I moved back home anyway because my grandmother couldn't deal with the monetary cost of my habits.\n\n**TL;DR I watched so much porn whilst living with my grandmother that she kicked me out.

{"original_text": "This didn't happen today, but I need to tell the world.  Here's the backstory:\n\nA little while back, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about what would be the worst thing to get beaten up with.  We quickly settled on a dildo.  Just imagine getting into a fight and, instead of a knife, the guy pulls an enormous dildo and beats the ever loving piss out of you with it.  Emasculating AND painful.  So needless to say, I quickly went off to Romantic Depot with a few friends to purchase a dildo so I could then go around getting into drunken fights all night.\n\nI was able to procure a quite wonderful 16 inch black double ended dildo.  It was perfect: fit nicely in the hand, heavy enough to leave a welt, and just wiggly enough to provide a good smacking.  We went and got drunk and immediately started wandering around my college campus antagonizing everyone we could find at which point I would pull the dildo out from my inside jacket pocket and start whacking people with it.  Pretty much everyone found it hilarious and a few people posed for pictures.\n\nAs time went on, I began to use the dildo less and less and eventually threw it into the trunk of my car where I would bring it out only on special occasions.  A special occasion being, let's say, sitting awkwardly next to someone at a red light in the middle of the night and needing a prop to play with until they look over and I can make horrible eye contact with them (quick aside: I drive a hatchback, so the dildo could be accessed quickly by a passenger when the moment called for said dildo).\n\nEventually, the dildo fell out of use and I became accustomed to the sound of it rolling around in the trunk.  Every time I accelerated I could hear it roll to the back and thud against the door, every time I braked I could hear it roll forward and thud against the seats.  People would ask,\"what's that sound?\" to which I would reply, \"oh, that's just my dildo.\"  Eventually, I got tired of explaining the story of the dildo to people and threw it in a messenger bag that remained in my trunk.\n\nSOME TIME PASSES\n\nI woke up one morning and as I was eating breakfast, my dad came into the kitchen and told me he had taken my car to the car wash.  He had wanted them to vacuum inside so he cleaned everything out.  All of the things that had been in my car were on the side of the garage.  I went out to the garage and found all of the crap that had piled up in the car stacked neatly against the wall.  I started loading everything back in the car when I remembered the dildo in the messenger bag.  I opened the bag.  There was no dildo.\n\nI searched and searched and could not find the dildo.  There can only be one explanation.  And my dad hasn't said anything.  And it's been a little while now and he still hasn't brought it up.  And I'll never say anything either.\n\nBut until the day he dies, my father will know that his son, at one point in time, owned a sixteen inch double ended floppy black dildo.  And he will never know why.\n\ntldr I bought a dildo and my dad found it and we aren't talking about it", "tldr": " i bought a dildo and my dad found it and we aren't talking about it", "summary_text": "bought a dildo, used it to beat people, threw it in the trunk of my car, and my dad took it to the car wash.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.34999999531250003, "p": 0.28, "r": 0.4666666666666667}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.15789473218836578, "p": 0.125, "r": 0.21428571428571427}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.36363635886134077, "p": 0.3, "r": 0.46153846153846156}}], "compression_ratio": 0.03501945525291829, "original_pos_tags": {"DT": 66, "VBD": 46, "RB": 42, "VB": 33, "NN": 102, ",": 21, "CC": 30, "PRP": 55, "VBP": 4, "TO": 18, ".": 31, "VBZ": 9, ":": 3, "JJ": 27, "VBG": 16, "IN": 63, "WP": 2, "MD": 16, "JJS": 1, "VBN": 13, "RP": 7, "NNP": 6, "NNS": 11, "CD": 4, "PRP$": 12, "WDT": 5, "JJR": 1, "RBR": 1, "WRB": 4, "POS": 1, "(": 1, ")": 1, "''": 3, "``": 1, "UH": 1, "EX": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBD": 4, "DT": 3, "NN": 6, ",": 3, "PRP": 3, "TO": 2, "VB": 1, "NNS": 1, "IN": 2, "PRP$": 2, "CC": 1, ".": 1}}

{"original_text": "The NoFap community recommended I post this to r/TIFU\n\n###How r/NoFap ruined my only chance at a potential relationship \n    \n\nA couple months ago, I went on a 2nd date with a girl from OKcupid. Originally we planned to go snowtubing but the snow had melt. Instead she invites me over for dinner. I get there, it's just us and it\u2019s going really good. But then, her roommate and his mom shows up. We all hang out and play board games. Now her roommate\u2019s mom is really hot, (and since I was 21 days nofap) I decide to playfully flirt with the mom. The mom is totally into it. It gets late though, and she eventually leaves. It's only me, my date and her roommate left. I suppose her roommate didn't enjoyed me flirting with his mom because I was cock-blocked the rest of the night. \n    \n\nAt about 12:30am, we're all very tired and the roommate asks if i'm going to spend the night, (*awkward*). So, they set me up in the \"Guest Loft\" which is an alcove/cubby about 6 feet off the ground right next to this girls room. I'm so exhausted that I just crash instead of waiting up for her to finish brushing her teeth (I should have waited). I\u2019m asleep in this guest loft, right next to this girl's room and I start having crazy sexual dreams. One of the dreams is so intensely sexual that I wake up right away realizing something bad. I look down and see that I justed blasted about 21 days worth of jizz into my underwear (wet dream).\n    \n\nI think \u201choly fuck this is bad - You can't get invited to a girls house and then jizz all over her guest room bed.\u201d I'm freaking out, perhaps I should just run out to my car, leave and never return. I don't know what else to do. So I decide that is my plan. It\u2019s really cold outside and I remember that my sweatshirt is on the floor next to the bed. So i lean over the bed head-first to grab my sweatshirt... except, i totally forgot that I\u2019m in a loft. I end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.\n    \n\nAt the last moment, I catch myself on a panel of wood and cabinet. Unfortunately I break both of them, cracking the wall and causing a giant banging sound. Now i'm fucked, I just jizzed all over the place broke her cabinet and the wall, everyone must have heard it! So i run to the bathroom in my sticky underwear while carrying my jeans. Finally some good luck. It\u2019s looks as if all the jizz stayed in my underwear. But now I have to figure out what to do with a destroyed pair of underwear. Do I try to hide it somewhere? Where? They must have heard the crash. They are probably right outside looking to see what happened. I quickly ball up the underwear and shove it down my pants. I go back to the bed and no one is there?!. I look around for jizz evidence. I can't find any, but its dark (i'm like 90% sure that it all stayed in my underwear!) Now my only concern is the smell. I mean, c'mon it's 21 days\u2019 worth of cum. And, she's sleeping, at most,  15 ft away in her room.\n    \n\nAnyways, I start to get tired, think *screw it* (she lived 45 min away, it's not like it was a coworker and I would be permanent known as the creep who masturbates all over your guest room while you sleep). So I laydown and fall back asleep. I wake up to sounds of the girl moving around the house. She goes downstairs, so I have quickly make the bed while looking for any cum stains (I didn't see any!). I put all my clothes on while she comes back up the stairs. She jokes about how I'm trying to break her house into pieces. All of a sudden, in slowmotion, i see her nostrils flair. She is starting to smell the jizz! I quickly make some excuse about having to grab some mouthwash from my car. I run out to the and secretly pull the underwear out of my pants and stash it. Now, I made it thus far. I decide to push my luck,  I come back into the house and we hang out for like 2 hours, nothing awkward at all. \n\nI spent all the next day waiting for a text message: \"Did you cum all over the guest loft?\"\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n**tl;dr** 21 days nofap, I go on my first date in over a year.

Were you aware that your USB is named 'horse porn'? I'm not sure I want to open that file anyways, care to explain yourself?\" \n\n**SHIT**\n\nFlashback to freshman year.

As more time passed, it started to really burn. By the time my lesson was finally over, it felt like Satan was taking a shit on my face. I rushed home and stuck my head in the sink, hoping it would quench the fire erupting on my face. Boy was I wrong. The water just made it worse, if that was possible. Warm water was a little better, but at that time I was just trying to get the rest of the Epiduo off, if there was any left.

{"original_text": "This actually happened last weekend, and I feel that I need to preface that I am a 28 year old female and I have camped many times, but I always make sure to have a potty nearby because my biggest fear is what happened. \n\nI live in Idaho and it's been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half. Some friends and I decide to go down to the river and hang out, play with the dogs, whatever. Before we left I kinda had to poo but I couldn't do it, it was more of a \"I'm gonna have to go eventually\" kind of thing. \n\nSo we go to a part of the river that I've never been to, you have to walk some trails to get down there. So we get there and I jump in right away cause I've had to pee forever and it's the river, that's what you do. About 7 minutes after that I realize that I have to go. I think to myself that I can hold it, I just have to get out of the water for a bit. So I go sit down and realize this is not one of those moments, this is a monster that has to get out of me. \n\nSo I get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails. One of my friends asks where I'm going an I have to go so bad I just say \"Illberightback!\" as fast as possible, cause losing focus on this means I will for sure have feces in my swimsuit.\n\nI get back to the main trail and start walking along, trying to find a place where there is a log or something that I can squat over that is also not in the view of people, but it gets so bad that I just said \"fuck it\" and found the closest log available. I am so lucky that there happens to be a whole dug already, so all I have to do is squat down and sit on the log.\n \nThis is where the problem occurs. I have a soaking wet swimsuit on, that is a pain in the ass to get off, and when I get down ready to go, I panic. My butt is like \"nope nope nope\" when it touches the log and I panic. So while my body was ready to free this beast, my brain was like \"ABORT!\"\n\nSo it starts to go and I am stuck in this almost kneeling position on the ground and I don't know what to do cause I can't stop myself from pooping. So I just let it go, and I lost my balance and ended up shatting on my foot. It was warm and as disgusting as you could imagine. I was annoyed and grossed out and panicky at that moment, but nothing prepared me for what came next: I had nothing to wipe with. I look around for leaves or a stick or SOMETHING, ANYTHING to end this, and then I start to think \"what if those leaves are poisonous? What if the stick gives me splinters? I don't want splinters in my butthole.\" \n\nLuckily I happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit, so I begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with it. I then threw it in the whole, and buried the entire remnants of the horrific situation at hand. \nThen I had the matter of getting the poo off me. Instead of going back and facing my friends, I walked further down the trail to find a place more secluded than where we were. I hope in the river and start washing myself off as best as I can and I glance up and there is a fly fisherman about 25 feet away from me. I see him and he turns around like \"wtf are you doing?\" so I nod and proceed to rinse myself off as quickly as possible. \n\nI then went back to where my friends were and proceeded to tell them my story. They all laughed and told me I was riding on top of the car on the way back. \n\nTL:DR I am a grown professional female who doesn't know how to shit in the woods.", "tldr": " i am a grown professional female who doesn't know how to shit in the woods.", "summary_text": "went down to the river, had to poop, had to squat over a log, my butt touched the log, and my brain was like \"abORT!\"", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.14999999531250016, "p": 0.12, "r": 0.2}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.11764705389273376, "p": 0.10526315789473684, "r": 0.13333333333333333}}], "compression_ratio": 0.03424056189640035, "original_pos_tags": {"DT": 64, "RB": 54, "VBN": 8, "JJ": 29, "NN": 76, ",": 24, "CC": 42, "PRP": 92, "VBP": 49, "IN": 85, "TO": 35, "VB": 46, "CD": 6, "NNS": 21, "PRP$": 13, "JJS": 2, "VBZ": 24, "WP": 7, "VBD": 27, ".": 35, "NNP": 3, "RP": 8, "WDT": 2, "MD": 7, "JJR": 1, "``": 7, "VBG": 14, "''": 7, "WRB": 8, "EX": 3, "PDT": 1, ":": 2, "RBR": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBD": 5, "RB": 1, "TO": 3, "DT": 3, "NN": 6, ",": 4, "VB": 2, "RP": 1, "PRP$": 2, "CC": 1, "IN": 1, "``": 1, ".": 1, "''": 1}}

{"original_text": "I work at a chain restaurant and lately we have had a lot of \"coupon fraud.\" Basically, this means servers steal stacks of coupons or print them from their computer under false emails (or snatch them out of local newspapers but this is more rare) and add them to all their cash checks. Since they are their \"own bank\" and don't pay the restaurant until the end of the night, those coupons that were never really used when someone gives them cash and says keep the change end up being an extra five, ten, whatever dollars in their pocket... sometimes costing us hundreds and hundreds of dollars in losses, impacting manager salaries and bonuses, and also impacting even other hourly employees who are on the upper end of the ladder trying to move up.\n\nI found out this mass coupon fraud was going on, and I \"checked in\" a friend to her shift. Not super close, but I've been to her house and drank after work and never had any problems with her. She seemed like a pretty cool chick. I had suggested we search all of the servers' books for coupons, so I was searching them all. I flipped hers open when she set it down when she walked in, and unfortunately, there was a stack of coupons in there... Which should be impossible as all coupons actually used are to be turned in at the end of the night, and any that are found are to be turned in and destroyed immediately. Basically, if you have a big stack like that, it means you are planning to steal.\n\nThere were so many witnesses that I couldn't have covered for her even if  I wished to do so.

My phone is in sorta in a weird position,(sometimes i put my phone in my pocket sideways and it sorta sticks out) and I can't grab it to get it flat in my pocket since the woman's ass is basically on my leg. So I brilliantly decide to rub my leg, with my phone pointed out against her to get it flat in my pocket. You can probably guess what she thought, that I had basically rubbed my erect dick against her. She sorta twitches but there's no room to move, my phone with its pretty hard case stays up against her for another 5 or 6 minutes before she gets off. When she does get off, I can't stop myself from glancing at her face to see if she was thinking what i thought she was thinking. She glares at me with disgust and I immediately turn away. I know I'll never see her or her friends again, but it was a really awkward bus ride, not only cause of the phone thing, butt because I was stuck against a chubby woman who was like 45+ for like 6 minutes.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet I reached for the tp so I could check the damage... 3 fucking squares left...3.

By some miracle the last square indicated a clean surface but by this time I had been in there way longer than a #1.

{"original_text": "I, 22f, am studying abroad in Argentina this semester. As I am well aware, the country is currently in a state of economic distress and, as the unemployment rate is extremely high, many of the inhabitants have resorted to petty crime, such as pickpocketing, in an attempt to make ends meet. There's the background.\n\nA few days ago (today I didn't fuck up.. but I sure did on Saturday morning) I was leaving a guy's apartment after he had already left to go to work. I get myself all ready to go and see half of the joint we had smoke from the night before sitting in the ashtray on the table. I have nothing else really to do the rest of the day so I decide to take a few puffs. Feeling nice and buzzed, I put my iPhone headphones in my hears, turned on my music and went along my way. After realizing the commute home would have been a 1.5 hour long walk I decide to wait at the 124 bus stop. There were trucks parked in the spaces in front of the stop so it was difficult to see the bus and to consequently hail it down. The woman in front kept walking into the street to see if the bus was coming, so I figured I'd leave that to her in order to eventually get on the bus. This was my first mistake, being completely still giving my assailants time to scope me out. A few minutes later a man comes up to me and mentions I have a stain on my back and that I should clean it. I feel around my coat and find nothing, so I continue in my trance from the playlist and the sunny day and the weed and the waiting. Then another woman comes up and AGAIN mentions that there's something on my back. At this point I start to feel around my shoulders and when I pull my hand back I see that there is a huge glob of saliva on my skin. There are several trails of spit on my clothes. Fucking gross. I also didn't know that throwing liquids/trash/SPITTING on people is a means of distraction for pickpocketers. Awesome.. yay ignorance. While trying to clean myself up I become hazily aware of this woman and her two children standing uncomfortably close to me. I was on a busy street and I didn't think much of it, though my personal space was most definitely invaded. I didn't even notice my music stop playing. All of a sudden she's gone and a street vendor is yelling at me, bringing me down to earth telling me that I had just been robbed. Then it all clicks.\n\nOf COURSE that's what just happened!\n\nMy initial reaction was.. uh.. wait... what.. OH WHAT THE FUCK!!! and i just kept thinking to myself: \"why the fuck didn't this vendor intervene while he saw everything happening!?!?\" I mean maybe the people were armed, there's many reasons. So he tells me that she got onto a bus that was (wow just my luck!) stopped at the red light a few yards away. As i confusedly approach, I realize that there are three buses, all completely stuffed. There's no way that I am finding her ever again. Had my iPhone jacked right out from under my nose. Felt like a total idiot, also violated from the saliva shower. Only solace is that the screen was completely fucked.

{"original_text": "A wee bit of backstory: I don't drink hard liquor, I don't like it and it doesn't like me. I can drink wine and beer regularly with little to no issue but stay away from the hard stuff. Amongst my friends and family there is a standing ban against two types of liquor specifically; vodka, because it makes me cry like a baby, and tequila, because I will (attempt) to have sex with pretty much anything. Now I think whiskey will be added to that list.\n\nThe Story: My Wife and I are prepping up for a night of pizza, booze, TV at the liquor store and I reach for my old familiar 6 pack. She says that she is bored with beer and had heard one of her friends talking about how delicious Rye Whiskey and lemonade are, so I consent and grab a bottle.\n\nWe get home and start mixing drinks, and the mixture is quite delicious. It has the sweet tang of lemonade and the oaky warmth of whiskey but zero alcohol taste, this is a bad thing. The drunker I get the less I can taste the alcohol, so the stronger I make the drinks, so the drunker I get and it snowballs from there.\n\nMy next memory is waking up the next morning, still very drunk, and feeling like I've been trampled by a team of horses. My wife has already left for work an hour ago, so I get dressed rather sloppily and head out myself. I carpool and it was not my day to drive so I didn't drive drunk. I make it there and get settled in with a muffin to soak up the alcohol and text my wife to see why I am so sore. Her reply, \"You bit me and I kicked the shit out of you.\" I go to the bathroom and lock the door and take off my shirt to find my side and shoulder to be one giant bruise.\n\nThese are the events of the evening as pieced together from my wife's story. I drank most of the bottle of whiskey by myself.  She had two drinks with ~2 shots each, and I had the rest. I was not able to make it through the Daily Show and Colbert Report so my wife drug me to bed and tried to have sex with me. By this point I apparently had unprecedented levels of whiskey dick so that wasn't going to happen and I just yelled/sobbed drunkenly into my pillow for a while. She finds the quite amusing and starts jokingly saying things like about me being impotent (which I'm not normally) just so she can laugh at my over the top responses.\n\nEventually I just get annoying and it late so she rolls over and tries to go to sleep, accidentally pulling the covers off of me. So, I do what any rational person would do and bite her. And not a nibble either, I lock on like a pitbull and don't let go, apparently I also pull her hair. My wife slugs me in the forehead until I let go, then a few more times in the side of the head and the shoulder/rib area for good measure before kicking me (literally) out of bed.\n\nShe isn't mad, in fact she finds it quite hilarious. But I have never felt worse (mentally or physically) and it doesn't help when she makes spousal abuse jokes.\n\nTL;DR I'm a light weight, I fight like a girl, and my wife has a wicked left.\n\nEdit : Some words.", "tldr": " i'm a light weight, i fight like a girl, and my wife has a wicked left.", "summary_text": "don't drink hard liquor, don't drink whiskey, don't have sex with your wife, and don't have sex with your dick.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.05555555061728439, "p": 0.05, "r": 0.0625}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.07692307195266304, "p": 0.08333333333333333, "r": 0.07142857142857142}}], "compression_ratio": 0.036840358446730836, "original_pos_tags": {"DT": 54, "JJ": 31, "NN": 91, "IN": 69, ":": 5, "PRP": 68, "VBP": 29, "RB": 50, "VB": 34, ",": 24, "CC": 40, "VBZ": 19, ".": 29, "MD": 6, "TO": 15, "NNP": 12, "PRP$": 17, "NNS": 18, "EX": 2, "VBG": 12, "CD": 6, "(": 4, ")": 4, "WP": 2, "VBN": 11, "RP": 5, "VBD": 11, "WRB": 3, "JJR": 3, "``": 1, "''": 1, "POS": 1, "JJS": 1, "WDT": 1}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBP": 4, "RB": 4, "VB": 4, "JJ": 1, "NN": 6, ",": 3, "IN": 2, "PRP$": 2, "CC": 1, ".": 1}}

If I was wealthy and could maintain a high balance, the account would be free.  That just seems horribly wrong to me.\n\nSo today was payday.

{"original_text": "Ok, so this happened a couple weeks ago in my research lab. This might be a little confusing if you aren't a scientist or chemist, but I'll try to make it readable for you non-scientists out there. BTW, I am an undergraduate researcher, so you can imagine some of the stupidity that will ensue.\n\nI work in a lab that tries to make crystals to see if a unique chemical structure is formed. One time I was using ethanol (alcohol) as a solvent for my reaction, and I knew that the product formed from the reaction would not crystallize with ethanol, so I had to vaporize the ethanol out of the solution by heating the solution beaker on a hot plate. Once the ethanol was vaporized, I was left with the product in the hot/warm beaker. \n\nNow this is an aside, for some reason or another the graduate TAs and research educator prof I work with in the lab do not use the vent (hood) for many dangerous chemicals, like dichloromethane. Maybe its because they find it inconvenient to work in the hood or maybe its because they work with dichloromethane so much they kinda forget about its dangers. So I thought since they don't use a hood when using dichloromethane, then maybe I don't need to, for the sake of \"efficiency\" (stupid mistake, very stupid). \n\nIN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW THE DANGERS OF DICHLOROMETHANE: The first thing you have to know is that it is potentially carcinogenic. The second thing is that if you inhale/consume enough of it, then you can/will get carbon monoxide poisoning because dichloromethane is metabolized into carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to temporary blindness/blurriness. The third thing is that dichloromethane has a relatively low boiling point temperature (point at which the liquid turns into a gas that you can breathe).\n\nNow that the solid product is in my hot/warm beaker with no liquid ethanol, I am supposed to dissolve the product in dichloromethane, so that it will crystallize in a couple days. OK, so here's when things go outta hand. I start to add dichloromethane into the beaker, and I notice that the dichloromethane was vaporizing, like when you add water to hot skillet when you are washing it after you used it on the stove. I thought, no big deal, I do this all the time to cool down pots and stuff at home, no harm done? WRONG! The next second, I took a normal breath of air. And my lungs sank like an anvil dropping to the bottom of an ocean. I realized what I had just done to myself. I, immediately, put the beaker into a vent (hood), and started breathing heavy to try and get as much dichloromethane out of my system as possible. I knew it was too late, but then I assured myself that I didn't breathe too much because I only put in like a couple mLs of dichloromethane into the beaker. I left lab and went outside for like 30 minutes, and thankfully I didn't feel any strong effects due to the dichloromethane, except for blurriness in my eyes for a couple minutes (I think the blurriness may have come from the placebo effect of knowing the side effects of inhaling dichloromethane b/c I was thinking of that first).\n\nI think I am lucky to be alive. Reddit, TIFU, and plan on not fucking up again in lab by being a shit ton more safe, rather than being \"efficient\". \n\nTL;DR I breathed a dangerous chemical because of stupid and unsafe lab techniques, and I should count myself lucky that nothing too dangerous occurred to my body because of it.

So I'm thinking to myself, \"I swear I just threw them down the chute...\" Then it hit me and I reached in my pocket and of course my two nice crisp twenties were missing. So I flew back to the garbage man (going 65 in a 35 with a jeep Cherokee mind you..) almost flipped my jeep on the way, and when I get there I explain the problem to the guy. What does he say? \"Just ran the compressor about a minute ago, sorry bud, keep the two stickers for next time though.\" All I could think was \"Fuck.... FUCK.\" Asked the guy if he knew what reddit was, he was old and of course said no but I told him I was putting it on here despite the fact he was probably thinking \"this kids a fuckin moron..\" Then went home and went directly to my ipad to inform the reddit community how much of a dumbass I am! \n\nTL;DR: threw fuckin 40 bucks down the garbage chute and got back a minute too late to have any hope of getting it back because my dumbass didn't realize it.

We both are big fans of the walking dead and are both pretty much up to the same point in the series, her always being a few episodes ahead. We love to discuss the show after I have caught up, so I was very excited as I made my way down the stairs one morning to talk about the episode I had watched the previous evening. I was so excited that when I came to the foyer, with my friend behind her desk facing me on the opposite side of the entrance hall, I couldn't help but start lumbering towards her, head cocked, arms writhing and outstretched, loudly snarling, moaning and groaning, doing the best zombie impression I could. I thought it would make my friend laugh, excite her for the upcoming zombie conversation, and also to try and distract her while she dealt with the lone customer who was stood with her back to me, talking to her. The hall was almost empty save the girl with her back to me. As I lurched ever nearer, I was confused as to why my friend was not smiling at my funny joke, but instead looking horrified and almost frozen with panic. It was too late before I realized why. Only two paces from the girl with her back to me, I continued with my brilliant impression, idiotically ignoring my friends grimace and instead increasing the vigor of my performance as I drew nearer.\n\n\nAll at once, with horror, I realized what I was doing. I heard the girls voice as she noticed me and spun around. I could not break character fast enough. We locked eyes, my face contorted, arms akimbo, body bent. She had downs syndrome.

As unlucky as I was, it slipped in between my teeth, went down my throat, tried to cough it up, made it even worse, and completely swallowed the damned thing without a problem. I still wonder how I did not choke on it. Well I tell my parents that it was just a qauter to lessen tension on them and go along the week until friday hoping it would pass. My hopes were nothing but crushed as 5 days go by without passage. So on friday we go and get an xray and waddya know, its still stuck in my stomach. Two days go on and were still hoping for the best. Suddenly, my little brother gets a stomach virus and starts vomiting all over. Bad news, since its still in my stomach by then, or as I thought, if I threw up it might come up and I could choke in it. OF COURSE AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT I WAKE UP ONLY TO START PROJECTILE VOMITING ALL OVER THE DAMN BATHROOM. The quarter didn't come out, luckily, but we still needed to go to the ER to make sure I was safe. So today I spent a good 5 hours in the ER, got two x rays done to find out it passed into my colon. But because it is so big, Theres a chance it might not pass and I would have to get surgery, BUT, theres also the possibility that it could just rip right through my colon causing me the worst pain of my life and giving me a Colin bag for my shit if I live on the outside of my body forever.

{"original_text": "So today was pretty horrible for me. Also, throwaway because some people I know at school browse Reddit and this subreddit quite frequently. And the last thing I need is someone to find out all of my dirty secrets\n\nToday was one of the last days of school (last official day for seniors is Friday) and we had gotten our yearbooks last Friday. Everyone has been signing each other's yearbooks and I was happy when I got to my first period because it means that I get to see my crush.\n\nA little background is in order. I'm a girl and so is the girl I like. I am bisexual and I haven't come out of the closet yet and I'm not quite ready to. I plan on doing it soon, but it's not just something I want to do overnight. Anyway, I've liked her for about three years and we are going to different colleges. We have first period together and I would say we're friendly acquaintances but not quite friends.\n\nEarlier in the year I got this bright idea to write a ridiculous love poem that I would put in her locker. I don't know why the hell I decided to do it, but I decided to do it. The poem is okay. It's not too cringy but it's not that bad. It is basically proclaiming my love for her from an anonymous person and saying that I will always have a place in my heart for her.\n\nSo this weekend I printed out the letter and I decided to seal it up nicely and put it in her locker. I left my 0 period class to go put it in her locker so that no one would see me. All went according to plan and I thought I was in the clear. Then I went to first period.\n\nSo in first period we're passing around yearbooks. I had this whole note planned out where I told her how much she impacted my life and etc. It was just supposed to be in a friendly way with no romantic overtones. Then I got distracted and got up for a second. When I came back, I forgot what I was writing. I finished the note and when I went to sign my name, I put a heart next to it with my name which was typical. Then I put \"I love you\".\n\nI didn't realize my mistake until I was handing it back to her. Luckily she doesn't read them until after we're done at school, but I'm freaking out about the consequences of this. I'm sure someone will notice and say something.\n\nAlso, I'm not the kind of girl who says \"I love you\" randomly to other girls. It seems out of place when I do it and almost everyone knows.

Couple minutes later, we bang, something something basilisk in her Chamber of Secrets. Sex is fun.\n\nWell, a couple days later I got curious. I decided that I needed to try ass play. Don't ask me the reasoning; I had it in my head (and later I would have it in my butt) that this was the only way to go for now. I looked around for something to use, but weirdly didn't have much to work with. Finally, I found an empty [blackberry Izze bottle] (http://i.imgur.com/ICPYhjc.jpg) that looked okay. I think even then I knew it wasn't my best idea, but I was also determined that *this empty beverage was gonna go in my butt, god damnit*.\n\nIt started off well. I had watched a little porn to understand what to do. You may not realize it, but the male prostate is only a couple inches past the anus; I didn't have to go deep. Nonetheless, I was enjoying it moderately and pushed my limits. I don't think it would have been my greatest orgasm, but then I never found out, so maybe I should reserve judgment. Anyway, I challenged myself to go deeper and deeper. By butthole was not used to this, and in a way it was like a competition with myself to prove that if I wanted to, I could get some surgery and star in Backdoor Sluts 12. It was enjoyable, if stressful. Then it got bad.\n\nI was doing this in my bedroom, ass in the air. Little did I notice how I had inched toward my low, wooden nightstand. I became a tad bored, I suppose, and with 1/2 the bottle from the opening up my ass and unaware of my future despair, I made the biggest mistake of my life: I jerked my ass up, slamming the bottle into the nightstand and **shattering the bottle inside my asshole.**\n\n**WHAT THE FUCK. JESUS. AWWW LORD REEKIS SOMEONE HELP THE FUCK MY BUTTHOLE MY BUTTHOLE JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!** The pain was the greatest I have felt in my life; the panic of the shattering, I believe, had caused my anus to close as tight as possible, trapping the broken glass inside. Furthermore, as I immediately slammed by ass to the ground, the glass inside further shattered. Imagine *pieces of broken fucking glass, too big for your rectum, desperately poking and clawing from the inside to escape, as your poor ass bleeds from the wounds inside*. Worse yet, simply *farting* caused the glass to sink deeper into my rectum. Yes, the slighest bowel gas or movement increased my pain ten-fold. I called the hospital and got an ambulence sent; they rushed me there (on a bumpy highway, mind you) and three hours later I was in surgery. I'm in a hospital bed now, and I can't look any of the nurses in the eye. Most of them giggle when they go over any treatments because they know what happened. My girlfriend literally cannot look at me without cracking up. She has taken to calling me Glass-ass, or the Broken Butthole.\n\n**TL;DR, I tried putting a bottle in my ass and it shattered, plunging me ino an infinity of pain and permanently bruising my manhood.

These jokes always began by saying \"Sometimes I\" and never made any sense whatsoever. Especially not to someone who wasn't in on the joke.\nIf I remember correctly, here was one of the jokes:\n\"Sometimes I pretend I'm John Lennon and fondle Mojo Jojo's tits.\"\nLike I said, these jokes had absolutely no point to them. At all.\nThere I was, writing in that notebook, when my Biology teacher realized I wasn't paying attention. She walked over to my desk, took my spiral, and continued teaching. In my mind I was panicking. I was so scared. After class, she called me up to her desk, and the worst thing imaginable happens... She opens the spiral. \nWith my terrible luck, she of course happened to flip to the worst joke in the whole book:\n\"Sometimes I rip my balls off with a chainsaw and then staple them back together.\"\nWhat the fuck was I thinking when I wrote those?

{"original_text": "A bit of background: I'm almost certain that I have an overactive bladder.\n\nIt's an incredibly windy day in the city that I reside in. I'm driving through an industrial area where there is quite a bit of crime, and therefore are virtually no public restrooms as they most likely would be frequented by rapists and junkies. I had drank heavily the evening before this, and had worked out during the morning, so I'm filled with water to rehydrate me from both activities. It hits me like a brick wall - I MUST pee, or I'm going to pee my pants. I pull into a gas station parking lot, run inside, and am told that they aren't allowed to let customers into the bathroom for safety reasons - fuck. Out of desperation, I walk next to the building and have an internal debate: Do I urinate in this parking lot? No, too many people and not an offense I need. I run back to my vehicle, and begin driving down the road praying for a restroom\n\n...and that's when I spot it. \n\nI haven't driven one block when I see the abandoned gas station with a lone porta-potty in the vacant dirt lot right next to it. I wouldn't normally use such a horrible facility, but it was either this or the seat of my car. I pull right up to the porta-potty, jump out and (leaving my car running) bust inside. As I'm taking an insanely high-pressure piss (this stream was truly powerful), I feel it...that...feeling in the rear. \n\nI try to hold the rear-end's contents in, but the sheer force from my bladder is causing everything in that entire region to let loose. I had my options: I can either, as a grown man, poop my pants, or pee on the porta-potty wall. I figured I had peed on less appropriate things at this age, and swung around while jerking my pants down to my ankles. \n\nAs I begin, as my friend once put it, \"chocolate shotgunning\" into the general area of the toilet, while still pissing all over in front of/on me, the wind, which has begun to pick up drastically, rips the porta-john door completely open. It is then that I first see another vehicle pulling into the parking lot.\n\nAs the truck pulls in, I frantically finish my business. A man exits the vehicle, begins to walk up, and I hurry to pull my pants up over my poop-covered butt and semi-soaked front. \n\nI exit my box of shame that is the porta-potty, and quickly close the door to it. As I turn and begin waddling toward my vehicle, he stops to talk to me for a few seconds about how windy it is. After nodding my head and smiling, I speed-walk to my vehicle as he opens the door to my mess. \n\nI couldn't bring myself to look in that direction, and sped out of the parking lot as fast as I could. \n\ntl;dr - Pooped and peed all over a porta-potty while the door was ripped open by the wind.

I sit down as a stream of brown liquid floods the porcelain throne in which I sit. Oh god the full blown squirts. 4 times in the past 2 hours have I shit the milky ooze. My toilet is clogged and I still have to shit. At this point my anus has the grand canyon tearing through my buttcheeks.\n\nI take a shower to cleanse by bungholio of its pain.

{"original_text": "Yesterday evening my mother and I were walking through the mall. I turned my head to the left and saw a beautiful casual dress in the window of Hot Topic: black with a pink \"galaxy\" pattern and white stars. It looked like someone had put pictures from a telescope on it. \n\nSeeing that the dress was only twenty five dollars, my mom agreed to buy it for me as a reward for my good grades if they had it in my size. I went inside, and a very nice but pushy saleslady showed me to the dressing room in the back to try it on. \n\nThere was a rather short velvet curtain covering the entrance. It was knee-height on me and had to be hooked to the side of the wall. I stood in the middle of the dressing room so I couldn't be seen through the small gap between the curtain and the wall, and to read an article about Death Cab for Cutie that was pasted to the low ceiling. \n\nAt that moment, I decided I wanted to see how the dress would look with the high-tops I was wearing at the moment. After struggling to get my jeans off over my giant feet, I realized the shoes looked stupid and tried to take them off. This was where the fuckup came.\n\nFor some odd reason, I didn't sit down on the nearby bench or lean on a wall. I stood in the middle of the closet-sized room on one leg and began trying to pull off my right shoe. However, the shoelaces are too small and even with the bow undone I couldn't get it off. Instead of merely sitting down, I continued to pull at the shoe, balancing there.\n\nA fireball of pain exploded in my left thigh, the leg I was balancing on. In my quest to remove my shoe, I had been putting a lot of strain on my left thigh muscle, which now gave out. The sudden pain made me lose my balance and I pitched forward, falling through the velvet curtain and onto the floor of the Hot Topic. \n\nThe dress took this opportunity and fly up, exposing my underwear and the back of my bra. The pushy saleslady grabbed a clothes rack on wheels and rolled it forward to shield me from the rest of the store, but I know a few people saw me. Five minutes later I staggered out, limping, and we bought the dress. \n\n**TL;DR Didn't sit down while taking off my shoes, got a cramp, exposed myself to a store full of special snowflakes.**", "tldr": " didn't sit down while taking off my shoes, got a cramp, exposed myself to a store full of special snowflakes.**", "summary_text": "didn't sit down while taking off my shoes, got a cramp, fell through a velvet curtain and exposed myself to a store full of special snowflakes.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.8510638248438207, "p": 0.7692307692307693, "r": 0.9523809523809523}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.7999999950617285, "p": 0.72, "r": 0.9}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.8636363586776858, "p": 0.7916666666666666, "r": 0.95}}], "compression_ratio": 0.06392489941886455, "original_pos_tags": {"NN": 73, "VBG": 15, "PRP$": 16, "CC": 19, "PRP": 36, "VBD": 40, "IN": 53, "DT": 55, ".": 22, "TO": 16, "JJ": 28, "NNP": 9, ":": 2, "``": 1, "''": 1, "NNS": 15, "VBN": 7, "RB": 19, "CD": 3, ",": 19, "VB": 19, "EX": 1, "MD": 3, "WDT": 2, "WRB": 2, "RP": 10, "VBP": 2}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBD": 4, "RB": 1, "VB": 1, "RP": 2, "IN": 3, "VBG": 1, "PRP$": 1, "NNS": 2, ",": 2, "DT": 3, "NN": 4, "CC": 1, "PRP": 1, "TO": 1, "JJ": 2, ".": 1}}
{"original_text": "*Using a throwaway because well, who knows who reads this site. Anyway, I never thought I would be worthy of a post here. Not because I think I'm perfect, but because my fuck ups usually are not that notable. I was wrong.*\n\nLet me set the scene for you: My wife and I just moved in with some family. Now by family, I mean grandmas house, her parents live here too, her sister and sisters husband, and their two kids. Not a huge house. Very Christian household. Anyway, we are currently stationed in a family room because all the bedrooms are occupied. We have a door to the outside that just so happens to be on the same outer wall as a door into a laundry room and office where the main door is left open and only the screen is in place. Now this sounds like no big deal, but to get into the house we have to go outside and back in through that office door. (We have the official doorway inside blocked) So I, as male, love peeing outside. \n\nAround 3am I wake up, feel the urge, and meander on out the door. At night, I don't make it in the other door. Why? Nobody is awake. PEE OUTSIDE! Ahhhhhhhhhh, sweet release. Well, also as male, I had a little chub going on down there. I figured \"What the hell, I am going to fap one out right here. Then I will go right back to sleep all comfy\" Proceed to a few minutes of outdoor, cool breeze fapping. It was glorious. Truly unlike any fap sesh in at least a year. I HEAR SOMEONE! Peek...look normal (dick in hand), nobody. Whew, scary. Well, it is three am. Why would anyone be in this secluded area of the house? \n\nProceed, and finish on lawn. Another sweet release. Much better this time. And then the inner door behind me shuts with such ferocity it is as if Dwayne Johnson was the mysterious being on the other side of that opaque window. What had they seen? Who was it? My mind races. I stand there for another couple minutes, then go back in. No sounds outside our room. I wake up this morning, nobody has said anything to my wife or I. I now live in a constant state of fear; fear of when or if I get asked what happened last night on the patio...\n\n***Reddit, today I fucked up.***\n\n**TL;DR** I may have incidentally met Dwayne Johnson.", "tldr": " i may have incidentally met dwayne johnson.", "summary_text": "fapped outside in the middle of the night in front of my wife's family. now living in a constant state of fear of being questioned about it.", "rougescores": [{"rouge-1": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-2": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}, "rouge-l": {"f": 0.0, "p": 0.0, "r": 0.0}}], "compression_ratio": 0.06398537477148081, "original_pos_tags": {"VBG": 5, "DT": 42, "NN": 77, "IN": 52, "RB": 35, ",": 26, "WP": 6, "VBZ": 11, ".": 39, "NNP": 15, "PRP": 34, "VBD": 12, "MD": 4, "VB": 16, "JJ": 37, "VBP": 20, "CC": 13, "PRP$": 7, ":": 5, "NNS": 8, "CD": 4, "VBN": 7, "PDT": 1, "TO": 8, "WDT": 1, "WRB": 4, "(": 2, ")": 2, "RP": 4, "``": 1, "''": 1, "JJS": 1, "UH": 1, "RBR": 1}, "summary_pos_tags": {"VBN": 2, "IN": 9, "DT": 3, "NN": 7, "PRP$": 1, "POS": 1, ".": 2, "RB": 1, "VBG": 2, "JJ": 1, "PRP": 1}}
