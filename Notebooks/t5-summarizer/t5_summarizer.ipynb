            " Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:I was for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary, on account ofthe contagious sickness which afflicted the city of Philadelphia, toconvene the National Legislature at some other place. This measure it wasdesirable to avoid, because it would occasion much public inconvenience anda considerable public expense and add to the calamities of the inhabitantsof this city, whose sufferings must have excited the sympathy of all theirfellow citizens. Therefore, after taking measures to ascertain the stateand decline of the sickness, I postponed my determination, having hopes,now happily realized, that, without hazard to the lives or health of themembers, Congress might assemble at this place, where it was next by law tomeet. I submit, however, to your consideration whether a power to postponethe meeting of Congress, without passing the time fixed by the Constitutionupon such occasions, would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794.Although I can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace inEurope and the restoration of security to the persons and properties of ourcitizens from injustice and violence at sea, we have, nevertheless,abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence forinterior tranquillity and personal security, for propitious seasons,prosperous agriculture, productive fisheries, and general improvements,and, above all, for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and acalm but steady determination to support our sovereignty, as well as ourmoral and our religious principles, against all open and secret attacks.Our envoys extraordinary to the French Republic embarked--one in July, theother in August--to join their colleague in Holland. I have receivedintelligence of the arrival of both of them in Holland, from whence theyall proceeded on their journeys to Paris within a few days of the 19th ofSeptember. Whatever may be the result of this mission, I trust that nothingwill have been omitted on my part to conduct the negotiation to asuccessful conclusion, on such equitable terms as may be compatible withthe safety, honor and interest of the United States. Nothing, in the meantime, will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and theattainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity ofwhich on many former occasions the people of the United States have givensuch memorable proofs, and the exertion of those resources for nationaldefense which a beneficent Providence has kindly placed within theirpower.It may be confidently asserted that nothing has occurred since theadjournment of Congress which renders inexpedient those precautionarymeasures recommended by me to the consideration of the two Houses at theopening of your late extraordinary session. If that system was thenprudent, it is more so now, as increasing depredations strengthen thereasons for its adoption.Indeed, whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with France, andwhether the war in Europe is or is not to continue, I hold it most certainthat permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtained. The stateof society has so long been disturbed, the sense of moral and religiousobligations so much weakened, public faith and national honor have been soimpaired, respect to treaties has been so diminished, and the law ofnations has lost so much of its force, while pride, ambition, avarice andviolence have been so long unrestrained, there remains no reasonable groundon which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection ordefense will not be plundered.The commerce of the United States is essential, if not to their existence,at least to their comfort, their growth, prosperity, and happiness. Thegenius, character, and habits of the people are highly commercial. Theircities have been formed and exist upon commerce. Our agriculture,fisheries, arts, and manufactures are connected with and depend upon it. Inshort, commerce has made this country what it is, and it can not bedestroyed or neglected without involving the people in poverty anddistress. Great numbers are directly and solely supported by navigation.The faith of society is pledged for the preservation of the rights ofcommercial and sea faring no less than of the other citizens. Under thisview of our affairs, I should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if Iforbore to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect ourcommerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as theonly sure means of preserving both.I have entertained an expectation that it would have been in my power atthe opening of this session to have communicated to you the agreeableinformation of the due execution of our treaty with His Catholic Majestyrespecting the withdrawing of his troops from our territory and thedemarcation of the line of limits, but by the latest authentic intelligenceSpanish garrisons were still continued within our country, and the runningof the boundary line had not been commenced. These circumstances are themore to be regretted as they can not fail to affect the Indians in a mannerinjurious to the United States. Still, however, indulging the hope that theanswers which have been given will remove the objections offered by theSpanish officers to the immediate execution of the treaty, I have judged itproper that we should continue in readiness to receive the posts and to runthe line of limits. Further information on this subject will becommunicated in the course of the session.In connection with this unpleasant state of things on our western frontierit is proper for me to mention the attempts of foreign agents to alienatethe affections of the Indian nations and to excite them to actualhostilities against the United States. Great activity has been exerted bythose persons who have insinuated themselves among the Indian tribesresiding within the territory of the United States to influence them totransfer their affections and force to a foreign nation, to form them intoa confederacy, and prepare them for war against the United States. Althoughmeasures have been taken to counteract these infractions of our rights, toprevent Indian hostilities, and to preserve entire their attachment to theUnited States, it is my duty to observe that to give a better effect tothese measures and to obviate the consequences of a repetition of suchpractices a law providing adequate punishment for such offenses may benecessary.The commissioners appointed under the 5th article of the treaty of amity,commerce, and navigation between the United States and Great Britain toascertain the river which was truly intended under the name of the riverSt. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace, met at Passamaquoddy Bay in1796 October, and viewed the mouths of the rivers in question and theadjacent shores and islands, and, being of opinion that actual surveys ofboth rivers to their sources were necessary, gave to the agents of the twonations instructions for that purpose, and adjourned to meet at Boston inAugust. They met, but the surveys requiring more time than had beensupposed, and not being then completed, the commissioners again adjourned,to meet at Providence, in the State of Rhode Island, in June next, when wemay expect a final examination and decision.The commissioners appointed in pursuance of the 6th article of the treatymet at Philadelphia in May last to examine the claims of British subjectsfor debts contracted before the peace and still remaining due to them fromcitizens or inhabitants of the United States. Various causes have hithertoprevented any determinations, but the business is now resumed, anddoubtless will be prosecuted without interruption.Several decisions on the claims of citizens of the United States for lossesand damages sustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures orcondemnations of their vessels or other property have been made by thecommissioners in London conformably to the 7th article of the treaty. Thesums awarded by the commissioners have been paid by the British Government.A considerable number of other claims, where costs and damages, and notcaptured property, were the only objects in question, have been decided byarbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens of the United States havealso been paid.The commissioners appointed agreeably to the 21st article of our treatywith Spain met at Philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide onthe claims of our citizens for losses they have sustained in consequence oftheir vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of His CatholicMajesty during the late war between Spain and France. Their sittings havebeen interrupted, but are now resumed.The United States being obligated to make compensation for the losses anddamages sustained by British subjects, upon the award of the commissionersacting under the 6th article of the treaty with Great Britain, and for thelosses and damages sustained by British subjects by reason of the captureof their vessels and merchandise taken within the limits and jurisdictionof the United States and brought into their ports, or taken by vesselsoriginally armed in ports of the United States, upon the awards of thecommissioners acting under the 7th article of the same treaty, it isnecessary that provision be made for fulfilling these obligations.The numerous captures of American vessels by the cruisers of the FrenchRepublic and of some by those of Spain have occasioned considerableexpenses in making and supporting the claims of our citizens before theirtribunals. The sums required for this purpose have in divers instances beendisbursed by the consuls of the United States. By means of the samecaptures great numbers of our sea men have been thrown ashore in foreigncountries, destitute of all means of subsistence, and the sick inparticular have been exposed to grievous sufferings. The consuls have inthese cases also advanced moneys for their relief. For these advances theyreasonably expect reimbursements from the United States.The consular act relative to sea men requires revision and amendment. Theprovisions for their support in foreign countries and for their return arefound to be inadequate and ineffectual. Another provision seems necessaryto be added to the consular act. Some foreign vessels have been discoveredsailing under the flag of the United States and with forged papers. Itseldom happens that the consuls can detect this deception, because theyhave no authority to demand an inspection of the registers and sealetters.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:It is my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those objectswhich by the Constitution are placed particularly within your sphere--thenational debts and taxes.Since the decay of the feudal system, by which the public defense wasprovided for chiefly at the expense of individuals, the system of loans hasbeen introduced, and as no nation can raise within the year by taxessufficient sums for its defense and military operations in time of war thesums loaned and debts contracted have necessarily become the subjects ofwhat have been called funding systems. The consequences arising from thecontinual accumulation of public debts in other countries ought to admonishus to be careful to prevent their growth in our own. The national defensemust be provided for as well as the support of Government; but both shouldbe accomplished as much as possible by immediate taxes, and as little aspossible by loans.The estimates for the service of the ensuing year will by my direction belaid before you.Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:We are met together at a most interesting period. The situations of theprincipal powers of Europe are singular and portentous. Connected with someby treaties and with all by commerce, no important event there can beindifferent to us. Such circumstances call with peculiar importunity notless for a disposition to unite in all those measures on which the honor,safety, and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertions ofwisdom and firmness.In all such measures you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence.\n"
